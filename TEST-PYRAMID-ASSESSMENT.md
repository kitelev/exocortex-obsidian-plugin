## Gap Analysis & Risk Assessment

### Critical Gaps

1. **Accessibility Testing** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - **Risk**: ADA compliance violations
   - **Impact**: Legal and usability issues
   - **Recommendation**: Implement axe-core testing

2. **Cross-Browser E2E** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - **Risk**: Browser-specific bugs
   - **Impact**: User experience degradation
   - **Current**: Focused on Electron/Obsidian
   - **Recommendation**: Add Chrome/Firefox/Safari tests

3. **Load Testing** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - **Risk**: Performance issues with large datasets
   - **Impact**: Plugin crashes with large vaults
   - **Current**: Some benchmark tests exist
   - **Recommendation**: Structured load testing

### Test Quality Issues

1. **Test Execution Time** (LOW PRIORITY)
   - Current: ~17 seconds for full suite
   - Target: <10 seconds for CI efficiency
   - Solution: Further test parallelization

2. **Coverage Thresholds** (LOW PRIORITY)
   - Current: 27-34% (conservative)
   - Industry Standard: 80%
   - Assessment: Intentionally conservative due to mocking complexity

## Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Sprint 1)

1. **Accessibility Testing Implementation**
   ```typescript
   // Proposed: tests/unit/accessibility/AccessibilityCompliance.test.ts
   describe('WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance', () => {
     it('should pass automated accessibility audit');
     it('should support keyboard navigation');
     it('should provide screen reader compatibility');
   });
   ```

2. **Performance Test Enhancement**
   ```typescript
   // Proposed: tests/performance/LoadTesting.test.ts
   describe('Large Vault Performance', () => {
     it('should handle 10,000 notes without degradation');
     it('should maintain <100ms query response with 50,000 triples');
   });
   ```

### Medium-term Improvements (Sprint 2-3)

    it('should expected_behavior', () => {
      // Given - Arrange
      // When - Act  
      // Then - Assert
    });
  });
});

// Test Organization
/tests
  /unit           - Isolated component tests
  /integration    - Multi-component interaction tests
  /e2e           - Full user journey tests
  /performance   - Speed and resource tests
  /security      - Vulnerability and safety tests
```

### Maintenance Practices

1. **Test Review Checklist**
   - [ ] Follows AAA pattern
