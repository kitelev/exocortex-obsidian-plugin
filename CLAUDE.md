# AI Assistant Development Guidelines for Exocortex Plugin

## üö® CRITICAL: MANDATORY AGENT USAGE
**EVERY significant task MUST use specialized agents.** Not using agents is a violation of project standards.

### ü§ñ AUTOMATIC META-AGENT INVOCATION
**NEW**: Meta-Agent automatically activates for ANY request meeting these criteria:
- **Complexity Score ‚â•3** (multiple files, cross-domain, technical standards)
- **Multiple Domains** (UI + Backend + Tests + Docs)
- **Keywords Detected**: implement, develop, analyze, optimize, test, fix, enhance
- **Professional Context**: Feature development, bug investigation, system analysis

### Agent Usage Rules (ENHANCED)
1. **ALWAYS use 3-5 agents in parallel** for any non-trivial task
2. **NEVER work alone** - agents provide specialized expertise  
3. **AUTO-PARALLEL EXECUTION**: Use domain-parallel, pipeline-parallel, or investigation-parallel patterns
4. **INTELLIGENCE-DRIVEN SELECTION**: Meta-Agent selects optimal agent combinations
5. **CONTINUOUS LEARNING**: Every success pattern automatically captured and reused
6. **Check META-AGENT-CORE.md** for auto-invocation system and CLAUDE-agents.md for patterns

## ü§ñ AI-First Development Approach
This codebase is optimized for development through AI assistants (Claude Code, GPT-5/Cursor, GitHub Copilot). All documentation, code structure, and workflows are designed for maximum AI comprehension and efficiency.

### üß† ENHANCED MULTI-AGENT INTELLIGENCE
- **26 Specialized Agents**: Complete professional software development coverage
- **Automatic Request Analysis**: NLP-powered complexity and domain detection
- **Parallel Execution Optimization**: 40-60% faster completion through intelligent orchestration

## üß† INTELLIGENT AGENT ORCHESTRATION

### Automatic Agent Selection Matrix

**NEW**: The Meta-Agent automatically selects optimal agent combinations based on request analysis:

```yaml
Request_Analysis_Engine:
  complexity_detection:
    simple (1-3): "Fix typo in docs" ‚Üí 1-2 agents, sequential
    moderate (4-6): "Add UI component with tests" ‚Üí 3-4 agents, parallel+review
    complex (7-8): "New feature with security" ‚Üí 4-6 agents, hybrid execution
    enterprise (9-10): "Architecture refactoring" ‚Üí 5-8 agents, full parallel

  domain_mapping:
    architecture: [architect-agent, swebok-engineer, security-agent, performance-agent]
    implementation: [swebok-engineer, code-review-agent, performance-agent]
    testing: [qa-engineer, test-fixer-agent, ui-test-expert]
    user_experience: [ux-researcher-agent, ux-design-expert, technical-writer-agent]
    quality_assurance: [qa-engineer, code-review-agent, security-agent]
    
  execution_patterns:
    domain_parallel: Multiple domains worked simultaneously
    pipeline_parallel: Sequential streams with parallel stages  
    investigation_parallel: Parallel analysis with consolidated resolution
```

### Parallel Execution Examples

**Feature Development Pipeline (Parallel)**:
```
Phase 1 (Parallel):     Phase 2 (Sequential):    Phase 3 (Parallel):
‚îú product-manager       ‚Üí swebok-engineer       ‚îú qa-engineer
‚îú architect-agent        (Implementation)        ‚îú technical-writer-agent
‚îú ux-design-expert                               ‚îî performance-agent
‚îî security-agent
```

**Bug Investigation (Parallel)**:
```
Investigation (Parallel):           Resolution (Parallel):
‚îú error-handler (root cause)       ‚îú swebok-engineer (fix)
‚îú code-searcher (exploration)      ‚îî test-fixer-agent (tests)
‚îú qa-engineer (test impact)
‚îî performance-agent (perf impact)
```

### Success Pattern Learning

Every successful agent execution is automatically analyzed and patterns extracted:
- **Agent combinations that work well together**
- **Optimal execution timing and dependencies** 
- **Quality metrics achieved**
- **Reusable templates for similar requests**

## üöÄ Quick Start for AI Assistants

### Understanding the Codebase
1. Start with `/src/main.ts` - plugin entry point
2. Review `/src/domain/` - core business logic
3. Check `/src/infrastructure/container/DIContainer.ts` - dependency wiring
4. Read test files for usage examples

### Making Changes
```bash
# 1. Run tests to verify current state
npm test

# 2. Make your changes following patterns in existing code

# 3. Run tests again
npm test

# 4. Build to verify compilation
npm run build

# 5. Update version and CHANGELOG.md
npm version patch/minor/major

# 6. Commit and push (triggers auto-release)
git add -A

```

## üìù Commit Message Format
```
feat: new feature
fix: bug fix
docs: documentation change
style: code style change
refactor: code refactoring
perf: performance improvement
test: test addition/modification
chore: maintenance task
```

## üö® Critical Rules (ENHANCED)

### RULE 0: MANDATORY META-AGENT INVOCATION (NEW)
**AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION**: Meta-Agent MUST be invoked for ANY request with:
- **Complexity ‚â•3** (multiple files, cross-domain, standards)
- **Keywords**: implement, develop, analyze, optimize, test, fix, enhance, create, build
- **Scope**: Feature development, bug investigation, system analysis, architecture
- **Quality**: Professional software development context

**VIOLATION**: Working alone on complex tasks is a project standard violation

### RULE 1: Always Release After Changes
Every code change MUST:
1. Update version in package.json
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with user-focused description
3. Commit with conventional message
4. Push to trigger auto-release

**AUTOMATED RELEASE**: Use `.claude/agents/release.sh` script or follow `.claude/agents/release-agent.md` checklist

### RULE 2: User-Focused Release Notes
Write CHANGELOG entries as Product Manager:
- Focus on user benefits, not technical details
- Include usage scenarios
- Use clear, non-technical language

### RULE 3: Test Before Push
- Run `npm test` before ANY commit
- Fix all test failures
- Maintain 70%+ coverage

### RULE 4: Follow Existing Patterns
- Study existing code before adding new features
- Use the same patterns and conventions
- Don't introduce new dependencies without need

### RULE 5: MANDATORY PARALLEL AGENT EXECUTION (NEW)
**ALWAYS USE 3-5 AGENTS IN PARALLEL** for any non-trivial task:
- **Domain-Parallel**: Multi-domain requirements executed simultaneously
- **Pipeline-Parallel**: Sequential streams with parallel stages
- **Investigation-Parallel**: Parallel analysis with consolidated resolution
- **Auto-Learning**: Every success pattern captured for future reuse

**REFERENCE**: See META-AGENT-CORE.md for execution patterns and CLAUDE-agents.md for agent selection

## ü§ù AI Assistant Collaboration (ENHANCED)

### For Claude Code (META-AGENT POWERED)
- **AUTO-INVOKE Meta-Agent** for request analysis and agent selection
- **USE PARALLEL EXECUTION** patterns for 40-60% faster completion
- **LEVERAGE SUCCESS PATTERNS** from previous agent orchestrations
- Use extended thinking for complex tasks
- Leverage memory bank for context
- Follow CLAUDE.md guidelines strictly

### For GPT-5/Cursor
- Provide clear, specific instructions
- Reference existing patterns in codebase
- Use type hints and interfaces

### For GitHub Copilot
- Write descriptive function signatures
- Use clear variable names
- Add JSDoc comments when needed
