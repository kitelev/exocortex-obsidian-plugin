# AI Assistant Development Guidelines for Exocortex Plugin

## üéØ UNIVERSAL EXECUTION COMMAND

### Quick Access via Slash Commands:

Custom slash commands are now available in `.claude/commands/` directory:

**Available commands:**

- `/execute [task]` - Execute with BABOK requirements interview, PMBOK planning, and full delivery pipeline
- `/status` - Check current progress and project health
- `/agents` - List available agents and capabilities
- `/release [type] [desc]` - **MANDATORY for releases** - Invokes release-agent with 20-step zero-tolerance process
- `/test [pattern]` - **MANDATORY for testing** - Invokes obsidian-qa-expert with Playwright hang prevention

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: For ANY release, ALWAYS use `/release` command. It guarantees release-agent execution.
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: For ANY testing, ALWAYS use `/test` command. It guarantees hang prevention and quality gates.

### üìã MANDATORY AGENT COMMAND USAGE

**CRITICAL**: Always use specialized agents through slash commands for these operations:

#### Release Operations - MANDATORY
```bash
/release [major|minor|patch] [description]
```
- **ALWAYS use this command** for ANY release
- **NEVER** manually execute release steps without this command
- **Agent**: release-agent (20-step zero-tolerance process)
- **Guarantees**: Version bump, tests, CI/CD, release creation, GitHub verification

**When to use `/release`:**
- ‚úÖ After committing code changes to src/, tests/, or production files
- ‚úÖ When user explicitly requests release creation
- ‚úÖ After feature completion requiring deployment
- ‚úÖ When CI/CD pipeline needs to be triggered
- ‚úÖ For version bump and changelog update

**VIOLATIONS - NEVER do these:**
- ‚ùå Manual version bump without `/release`
- ‚ùå Manual git tag creation
- ‚ùå Manual GitHub release creation
- ‚ùå Direct push expecting auto-release without verification

#### Testing Operations - MANDATORY
```bash
/test [unit|ui|component|all|pattern]
```
- **ALWAYS use this command** for comprehensive testing
- **NEVER** run `npm test` directly (risks Playwright hangs, missing quality gates)
- **Agent**: obsidian-qa-expert (20 years Obsidian/TypeScript/Playwright experience)
- **Guarantees**: Hang prevention, quality gates validation, BDD coverage check, failure analysis

**When to use `/test`:**
- ‚úÖ Before committing any code changes
- ‚úÖ After implementing new features or bug fixes
- ‚úÖ When debugging test failures
- ‚úÖ For comprehensive quality validation before release
- ‚úÖ When user explicitly requests test execution
- ‚úÖ As part of development workflow (TDD/BDD)

**VIOLATIONS - NEVER do these:**
- ‚ùå Direct `npm test` execution (Playwright may hang)
- ‚ùå Skipping BDD coverage check
- ‚ùå Skipping quality gates validation
- ‚ùå Not handling Playwright HTTP server hang
- ‚ùå Running component tests without timeout wrapper

#### Execution Operations - Optional but Recommended
```bash
/execute [task description]
```
- **USE for complex multi-step tasks** requiring multiple agents
- **Agent**: orchestrator (coordinates 3-5+ specialized agents)
- **Guarantees**: BABOK requirements, PMBOK planning, SWEBOK design, parallel execution

**When to use `/execute`:**
- ‚úÖ Complex feature implementation (multiple files, cross-domain)
- ‚úÖ Major refactoring or architecture changes
- ‚úÖ Full development pipeline execution (requirements ‚Üí design ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí testing ‚Üí docs)

### Why Mandatory Commands Matter

**Problem without commands:**
- ‚ùå Playwright hangs waste time (requires manual Ctrl+C, output analysis difficult)
- ‚ùå Forgotten quality gates (BDD coverage, performance, pass rate)
- ‚ùå Inconsistent release process (missed steps, incomplete verification)
- ‚ùå Manual work prone to human error

**Solution with commands:**
- ‚úÖ Automated hang prevention (timeout wrappers, output parsing)
- ‚úÖ Enforced quality gates (BDD ‚â•80%, 100% pass rate, performance thresholds)
- ‚úÖ Standardized processes (20-step release, 5-phase testing)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive reporting (failures analyzed, fixes suggested)
- ‚úÖ Agent expertise (20+ years experience encoded)

**Enhanced Execution Flow (v3.5.0):**
1. **BABOK Requirements Interview** - Structured requirements elicitation
2. **PMBOK Project Planning** - WBS, risk analysis, resource planning
3. **SWEBOK Engineering Design** - Technical architecture and patterns
4. **Parallel Agent Execution** - Orchestrated implementation
5. **Quality Gates & Release** - Automated validation and deployment

**Usage:** Type `/` in Claude Code to see available commands

**See `.claude/commands/` directory for command definitions**

## üö® CRITICAL: MANDATORY AGENT USAGE

**EVERY significant task MUST use specialized agents.** Not using agents is a violation of project standards.

### Agent Usage Rules

1. **ALWAYS use 3-5 agents in parallel** for any non-trivial task
2. **NEVER work alone** - agents provide specialized expertise
3. **Follow Feature Development Pipeline**: Product ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí QA ‚Üí Documentation
4. **Check CLAUDE-agents.md** for patterns and selection

## ü§ñ AI-First Development Approach

This codebase is optimized for development through AI assistants (Claude Code, GPT-5/Cursor, GitHub Copilot). All documentation, code structure, and workflows are designed for maximum AI comprehension and efficiency.

### üß† ENHANCED MULTI-AGENT INTELLIGENCE

- **27+ Specialized Agents**: Complete professional software development coverage with dynamic agent creation
- **Slash Command Integration**: Quick access via /execute, /status, /agents, /release, /test commands
- **Automatic Request Analysis**: NLP-powered complexity and domain detection
- **Parallel Execution Optimization**: 40-60% faster completion through intelligent orchestration
- **Success Pattern Learning**: Automated extraction and replication of winning approaches
- **Quality Gate Integration**: CMMI/ISO standards embedded in every agent interaction

## üîÄ Multi-Instance Development Workflow

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL AWARENESS**: This plugin is developed in PARALLEL by multiple Claude Code instances. Each instance works in a separate git worktree.

### Multi-Instance Environment Rules

**YOU ARE ONE OF SEVERAL PARALLEL DEVELOPERS:**
- 2-5 Claude Code instances working simultaneously
- Each instance operates in its own isolated git worktree
- Shared main repository - your changes affect others
- Coordination through git commits and GitHub Actions

### MANDATORY: One Task = One Worktree

**NEVER work directly in main worktree directory**

For EACH new task:
```bash
# 1. Create new worktree for the task
git worktree add ../exocortex-task-name -b feature/task-name

# 2. Move to worktree
cd ../exocortex-task-name

# 3. Sync with latest main
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main

# 4. Work on task in isolation
# ... your changes ...

# 5. Test locally
npm test:all

# 6. Commit (NO version bump - handled automatically!)
git commit -am "feat: description"

# 7. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/task-name
gh pr create --title "feat: description" --body "Detailed description..."

# 8. Wait for CI checks to complete
gh pr checks --watch

# 9. Auto-merge when all checks GREEN
gh pr merge --auto --squash

# 10. Cleanup after successful merge
cd /Users/kitelev/Documents/exocortex-obsidian-plugin
git worktree remove ../exocortex-task-name
git pull origin main  # Get auto-versioned commit
```

### Task Completion Criteria (MANDATORY)

**A task is COMPLETE only when ALL these steps pass:**

```
1. ‚úÖ npm test:all - ALL tests passing locally (100%)
2. ‚úÖ Changes committed with conventional commit message (feat:/fix:/etc)
3. ‚úÖ PR created and pushed to GitHub
4. ‚úÖ CI checks passing - build-and-test ‚úÖ + e2e-tests ‚úÖ
5. ‚úÖ PR merged to main (auto-merge or manual)
6. ‚úÖ Auto-version workflow completed (version bump automatic)
7. ‚úÖ Release created automatically and visible in GitHub Releases
```

**INCOMPLETE = NOT DONE**

If ANY step fails:
- ‚ùå Task is NOT complete
- ‚ùå Do NOT move to next task
- ‚ùå FIX the issue immediately (amend commit, force push, rerun checks)
- ‚ùå Do NOT leave broken code for other instances

**Version bumping is AUTOMATIC:**
- ‚úÖ NO manual `npm version patch` needed
- ‚úÖ NO manual manifest.json sync needed
- ‚úÖ NO manual CHANGELOG.md update needed
- ‚úÖ All handled by `pr-auto-version.yml` workflow after PR merge

### Pre-Work Synchronization (MANDATORY)

**BEFORE starting ANY task:**

```bash
# 1. Check current worktree location
pwd  # Should be in a task-specific worktree

# 2. Fetch latest from main
git fetch origin main

# 3. Check for conflicts with recent changes
git log main..origin/main --oneline  # See what changed

# 4. Rebase if needed
git rebase origin/main

# 5. Verify clean state
git status  # Should be clean
```

### Conflict Prevention in Multi-Instance Environment

1. **Small, Focused Tasks**: One feature/fix per worktree
2. **Frequent Syncs**: Pull from main before starting, after finishing
3. **Clear Commit Messages**: Help other instances understand your changes
4. **Fast Completion**: Don't leave worktrees open for days
5. **Clean Pipeline**: Never push broken code - it blocks everyone

### Why This Matters - Race Condition Solution

**Problem:** Manual version bumps create race conditions
```
Instance A: v12.5.10 ‚Üí v12.5.11 (push)
Instance B: v12.5.10 ‚Üí v12.5.11 (push)  ‚ùå COLLISION!
```

**Solution:** PR-based workflow with sequential merging
```
Instance A: PR merge ‚Üí auto-version ‚Üí v12.5.11 ‚úÖ
Instance B: PR merge ‚Üí auto-version ‚Üí v12.5.12 ‚úÖ
(GitHub merge queue ensures sequential processing)
```

In multi-instance environment:
- ‚úÖ **No version collisions** - GitHub merge queue is atomic
- ‚úÖ **No broken pipeline** - branch protection blocks bad merges
- ‚úÖ **No manual versioning** - automatic and consistent
- ‚úÖ **Safe rollback** - every change is a revertable PR

**Complete tasks fully. Push green code. Keep pipeline healthy.**

## üîí Branch Protection & Required CI Checks

**CRITICAL:** The `main` branch is protected. You CANNOT push directly to main. All changes MUST go through Pull Requests.

### Protected Branch Rules

**Branch:** `main`

**Enforcement:**
- ‚ùå **Direct pushes BLOCKED** - must use PR
- ‚úÖ **PR merge allowed ONLY if** all required checks pass
- ‚úÖ **Merge button disabled** until checks are GREEN
- ‚úÖ **Administrators cannot bypass** - rules enforced for everyone

### Required Status Checks

Before PR can be merged, these checks MUST pass:

1. **build-and-test** (from `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
   - Type checking
   - Linting
   - Build compilation
   - Unit tests
   - UI integration tests
   - Component tests (Playwright)
   - BDD coverage check (‚â•80%)

2. **e2e-tests** (from `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
   - End-to-end tests in Docker
   - Full plugin integration tests
   - Screenshot validation

**Both checks must be GREEN ‚úÖ before merge is possible.**

### Checking CI Status

```bash
# View current PR check status
gh pr checks

# Watch checks in real-time (wait until complete)
gh pr checks --watch

# View detailed status with JSON
gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup

# Attempt auto-merge (will fail if checks not green)
gh pr merge --auto --squash
```

### When Checks Fail

If any check fails (RED ‚ùå):

```bash
# 1. Identify the failure
gh pr checks  # See which check failed

# 2. Fix the code locally
# ... make fixes ...

# 3. Amend commit and force push
git commit --amend --no-edit
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/branch-name

# 4. Wait for checks to re-run
gh pr checks --watch

# 5. Merge when GREEN
gh pr merge --auto --squash
```

**NEVER skip failing checks. Fix them.**

### Setup (One-Time)

Branch protection is already configured. If you need to set it up on a new repository:

```bash
# Run automated setup script
.github/scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh

# Or see manual instructions
cat .github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md
```

### What You'll See

When trying to push directly to main:
```
remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed
To github.com:kitelev/exocortex-obsidian-plugin.git
 ! [remote rejected] main -> main (protected branch hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs
```

**This is CORRECT behavior. Use PR workflow instead.**

## üéØ Mission Statement

Execute every request as a highly qualified Senior IT specialist with extensive experience in knowledge management systems, semantic web technologies, and Obsidian plugin development.

## üìä Architecture Overview

### Terminology (CRITICAL)

**Layout Rendering:**

- **AutoLayout**: The plugin automatically displays related assets below metadata (frontmatter) in reading/preview mode. This is always enabled and requires no configuration.

**IMPORTANT**: Layout rendering is automatic and always active. Users see properties and relations tables below frontmatter in all notes when viewing in reading mode.

### Current Implementation (v12.2.5)

- **React Component Architecture** (v11.5.3): Isolated state management with independent table sorting
- **Clickable Instance Class Links** (v11.2.3): Instance Class displayed as internal links for quick navigation
- **Interactive Table Sorting** (v11.5.3): Independent sort state per table with visual indicators (‚ñ≤/‚ñº)
- **Archived Asset Filtering** (v11.3.0): Automatic filtering of archived assets with multi-format support
- **Mobile/iOS Support**: Complete mobile experience with touch-optimized UI and platform-specific optimizations
- **React Components**: AssetRelationsTable with grouping and independent sorting
- **Domain Layer**: Asset-based entities with Clean Architecture and mobile performance optimizations
- **Slash Commands**: Quick execution commands (/execute, /status, /agents, /release, /test) for efficient development workflow
- **Testing Excellence**: 14 tests passing (100%) - 6 UI + 8 component (React-only tests)
- **CI/CD**: Optimized GitHub Actions with automated releases on test success
- **Performance**: Fast build times (<1min), optimized bundle (206kb)
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with comprehensive test infrastructure and security validation
- **BOK Standards**: Full BABOK/PMBOK/SWEBOK compliance for enterprise-grade development

### Key Patterns Successfully Implemented

#### Repository Pattern

```typescript
interface IAssetRepository {
  findById(id: AssetId): Promise<Asset | null>;
  save(asset: Asset): Promise<void>;
  updateFrontmatter(
    path: string,
    frontmatter: Record<string, any>,
  ): Promise<void>;
}
```

#### Query Engine Abstraction Pattern (v3.0.0)

```typescript
interface IQueryEngine {
  executeQuery(
    query: string,
    context: QueryContext,
  ): Promise<Result<QueryResult>>;
  renderQuery(container: HTMLElement, query: string): Promise<Result<void>>;
  getPages(options: GetPagesOptions): Promise<Result<PageData[]>>;
}

// Factory with automatic fallback
class QueryEngineFactory {
  async createQueryEngine(
    preferred?: QueryEngineType,
  ): Promise<Result<IQueryEngine>> {
    // Auto-detection with fallback logic
  }
}
```

#### Mobile Performance Optimization Pattern (v3.0.0)

```typescript
class MobilePerformanceOptimizer {
  // Platform-aware performance tuning
  private readonly MOBILE_BATCH_SIZE = 10;
  private readonly DESKTOP_BATCH_SIZE = 50;

  // Adaptive caching based on device capabilities
  optimizeForDevice(operation: Operation): OptimizedOperation;
}
```

#### Touch Controller Pattern (v3.0.0)

```typescript
class TouchGraphController {
  // Gesture recognition with momentum and haptic feedback
  handlePinchGesture(event: TouchEvent): void;
  handlePanGesture(event: TouchEvent): void;
  provideMomentumAnimation(velocity: Vector2D): void;
}
```

#### Result Pattern for Error Handling

```typescript
export class Result<T> {
  static ok<U>(value: U): Result<U> {
    /* ... */
  }
  static fail<U>(error: string): Result<U> {
    /* ... */
  }

  isSuccess: boolean;
  getValue(): T | null;
  getError(): string;
}
```

#### Performance Optimizations

**IndexedGraph Implementation** (v2.8.0+)

- **Problem**: O(n) lookups in large graphs
- **Solution**: SPO/POS/OSP indexes for O(1) lookups
- **Result**: 10x query speed improvement
- **Batch Processing**: 5x faster bulk imports
- **Query Caching**: 90% cache hit rate with LRU cache

## üöÄ Quick Start for AI Assistants

### Understanding the Codebase

1. Start with `/src/main.ts` - plugin entry point
2. Review `/src/domain/` - core business logic
3. Check `/src/infrastructure/container/DIContainer.ts` - dependency wiring
4. Read test files for usage examples

### Making Changes (PR-Based Workflow)

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch in separate worktree
git worktree add ../exocortex-feature-name -b feature/description
cd ../exocortex-feature-name

# 2. Sync with latest main
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main

# 3. Make your changes following patterns in existing code
# ... code changes ...

# 4. Run tests locally (MANDATORY: use /test command or npm test:all)
npm test:all
# OR: /test

# 5. Build to verify compilation
npm run build

# 6. Commit with conventional message (NO version bump!)
git commit -am "feat: your feature description"

# 7. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/description
gh pr create --title "feat: description" --body "Detailed description..."

# 8. Wait for CI checks to pass
gh pr checks --watch

# 9. Merge when all checks GREEN
gh pr merge --auto --squash

# 10. Cleanup worktree
cd /Users/kitelev/Documents/exocortex-obsidian-plugin
git worktree remove ../exocortex-feature-name
git pull origin main  # Get auto-versioned commit

# Version bump, CHANGELOG update, and release happen automatically!
```

```

## üîß Development Guidelines

### 1. Code Style

- **NO COMMENTS** unless explicitly requested
- Self-documenting code with clear naming
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use TypeScript strict mode

### 2. Testing Requirements

- Write tests for all new code
- Maintain 70%+ coverage
- Use existing mock infrastructure
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

**MANDATORY - Use /test Command:**
- **ALWAYS use `/test` command** instead of direct `npm test`
- The obsidian-qa-expert agent handles Playwright hangs automatically
- Quality gates (BDD coverage ‚â•80%, 100% pass rate, performance) enforced automatically
- Comprehensive reporting with failure analysis included
- Specialized agent with 20 years Obsidian plugin testing experience

**CRITICAL - Prevent Test Hangs:**
- Playwright component tests may open HTTP server after completion
- If you ever see "Serving HTML report at http://localhost:XXXX. Press Ctrl+C to quit"
- IMMEDIATELY recognize this as process hang and analyze test results BEFORE the hang
- Test results appear BEFORE the HTTP server message
- Count passed/failed tests and proceed based on results, don't wait for process to exit
- **NOTE**: `/test` command handles this automatically with timeout wrappers

**Test Execution via /test:**
```bash
/test              # Run all tests (unit, ui, component) with quality gates
/test unit         # Run only unit tests
/test ui           # Run only UI integration tests
/test component    # Run only Playwright CT tests (hang-safe)
/test pattern      # Run specific test pattern
```

### 3. Architecture Principles

- **Clean Architecture**: Separate concerns by layer
- **SOLID**: Single responsibility, Open-closed, etc.
- **DDD**: Rich domain models
- **Privacy-First**: UUID-based public identifiers

### 4. Git Workflow

```bash
# Feature development
git checkout -b feature/description
npm test
# make changes
npm test
git commit -m "feat: description"
git push origin feature/description
# Create PR

# Direct to main (for AI assistants)
npm test
# make changes
npm test
git add -A
git commit -m "type: description"
git push origin main
# GitHub Actions handles release
```

## üìù Commit Message Format

```
feat: new feature
fix: bug fix
docs: documentation change
style: code style change
refactor: code refactoring
perf: performance improvement
test: test addition/modification
chore: maintenance task
```

## üö® Critical Rules (ENHANCED)

### RULE 0: MANDATORY AGENT USAGE

**ALWAYS use agents for complex tasks**:

- Multiple files, cross-domain work, or technical standards
- Feature development, bug investigation, system analysis
- Implementation, optimization, testing, or enhancement work

**VIOLATION**: Working alone on complex tasks is a project standard violation

### RULE 1: MANDATORY RELEASE AFTER EVERY CODE CHANGE

**CRITICAL**: EVERY code change to src/, tests/, or any production file MUST result in a release.

**NO EXCEPTIONS**: If you changed code, you MUST create a release. Period.

‚ö†Ô∏è **MULTI-INSTANCE CONTEXT**: You are one of several parallel developers. Your incomplete task or broken pipeline blocks other Claude Code instances from releasing. Complete ALL steps before considering task done.

### PR-Based Workflow (MANDATORY)

Every code change MUST follow this exact sequence:

**1. Create feature branch in separate worktree**
```bash
git worktree add ../exocortex-feature-name -b feature/description
cd ../exocortex-feature-name
```

**2. Sync with latest main**
```bash
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main
```

**3. Make changes and test locally**
```bash
# ... code changes ...
npm test:all  # MUST pass 100%
```

**4. Commit with conventional commit message**
```bash
git commit -am "feat: user-facing description"
# OR: fix:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, chore:
# BREAKING CHANGE in body triggers major version
```

**5. Push and create PR**
```bash
git push origin feature/description
gh pr create --title "feat: description" --body "Details..."
```

**6. Wait for CI checks (MANDATORY)**
```bash
gh pr checks --watch
# Both build-and-test and e2e-tests MUST be GREEN ‚úÖ
```

**7. Fix if any check fails (RED ‚ùå)**
```bash
# Fix the code
git commit --amend --no-edit
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/description
# Return to step 6
```

**8. Merge when all checks GREEN**
```bash
gh pr merge --auto --squash
# Branch protection enforces this - merge button disabled until GREEN
```

**9. Automatic version bump and release**
- ‚úÖ `pr-auto-version.yml` workflow auto-detects change type (feat/fix/BREAKING)
- ‚úÖ Auto-bumps version in package.json (patch/minor/major)
- ‚úÖ Auto-syncs manifest.json version
- ‚úÖ Auto-updates CHANGELOG.md
- ‚úÖ Commits changes to main
- ‚úÖ `auto-release.yml` workflow creates GitHub release

**10. Cleanup worktree**
```bash
cd /Users/kitelev/Documents/exocortex-obsidian-plugin
git worktree remove ../exocortex-feature-name
git pull origin main  # Get auto-versioned commit
```

**11. Verify release created**
```bash
gh release list --limit 1
# Should show new version
```

### What You DON'T Do Anymore

**NO MANUAL VERSION MANAGEMENT:**
- ‚ùå NO `npm version patch/minor/major`
- ‚ùå NO manual manifest.json editing
- ‚ùå NO manual CHANGELOG.md updates
- ‚úÖ All handled automatically by GitHub Actions

### Race Condition Solution

**OLD PROBLEM** (manual versioning):
```bash
Instance A: v12.5.10 ‚Üí bump ‚Üí v12.5.11 ‚Üí push  ‚ùå
Instance B: v12.5.10 ‚Üí bump ‚Üí v12.5.11 ‚Üí push  ‚ùå COLLISION!
```

**NEW SOLUTION** (PR-based with auto-versioning):
```bash
Instance A: PR merge ‚Üí auto-version ‚Üí v12.5.11  ‚úÖ
Instance B: PR merge ‚Üí auto-version ‚Üí v12.5.12  ‚úÖ
(GitHub merge queue ensures sequential atomic processing)
```

### VIOLATIONS AND CONSEQUENCES

‚ùå **WRONG**: Trying to push directly to main
```bash
git commit -m "fix: button rendering"
git push origin main
# ‚ùå REJECTED by branch protection
```

‚ùå **WRONG**: Merging PR with failing checks
```bash
gh pr merge --admin  # Bypass checks
# ‚ùå VIOLATION - breaks pipeline for everyone
```

‚úÖ **CORRECT**: PR-based workflow with all checks passing
```bash
# Feature branch workflow
git worktree add ../exocortex-fix-button -b fix/button-rendering
cd ../exocortex-fix-button
# ... fix code ...
npm test:all  # ‚úÖ All pass
git commit -am "fix: button rendering in mobile view"
git push origin fix/button-rendering
gh pr create --title "fix: button rendering" --body "..."
gh pr checks --watch  # ‚úÖ Wait for GREEN
gh pr merge --auto --squash
# ‚úÖ Auto-version creates v12.5.11
# ‚úÖ Auto-release creates GitHub release
```

### Why This is CRITICAL

**Multi-instance coordination:**
- ‚úÖ No version collisions - sequential merging
- ‚úÖ No broken pipeline - branch protection enforces quality
- ‚úÖ No manual errors - automation handles versioning
- ‚úÖ Safe rollback - every change is a PR

**User impact:**
- Users get fixes immediately after PR merge
- Every improvement reaches users through consistent release process
- Clear version history with meaningful changes
- No confusion about what version has what features

**Task completion checklist:**
- [ ] Feature branch created in separate worktree
- [ ] Changes tested locally (npm test:all ‚úÖ)
- [ ] Conventional commit created
- [ ] PR created and pushed
- [ ] CI checks passed (build-and-test ‚úÖ + e2e-tests ‚úÖ)
- [ ] PR merged to main
- [ ] Auto-version workflow completed
- [ ] Release created and visible in GitHub Releases
- [ ] Worktree cleaned up

### RULE 2: User-Focused Release Notes

Write CHANGELOG entries as Product Manager:

- Focus on user benefits, not technical details
- Include usage scenarios
- Use clear, non-technical language

### RULE 3: Test Before Push (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS run the FULL test suite before creating ANY commit:**

```bash
npm test
```

This runs:
1. `npm run test:unit` - Unit tests
2. `npm run test:ui` - UI integration tests
3. `npm run test:component` - Playwright component tests

**Requirements:**
- ALL tests must pass (100%)
- Fix all test failures before committing
- Maintain 70%+ coverage
- NEVER commit broken tests
- NEVER skip tests to "fix later"

**Why this is critical:**
- Broken commits block CI/CD pipeline
- Failed releases waste time and break trust
- Testing locally is faster than waiting for CI
- Prevents embarrassing rollbacks

**Checklist before EVERY commit:**
- [ ] `npm test` executed locally
- [ ] All test suites passed
- [ ] No test failures or errors
- [ ] Build successful (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Ready to commit

**CRITICAL - NEVER BYPASS PRE-COMMIT HOOKS:**
- **NEVER use `--no-verify` flag** to skip pre-commit hooks
- Pre-commit hooks exist to protect code quality and prevent broken commits
- If hooks fail, FIX the underlying issue, don't bypass the check
- Bypassing hooks is a serious violation of development standards
- If you encounter technical issues with hooks (e.g., environment-specific problems), fix the hook itself or the environment

**Why this is critical:**
- Pre-commit hooks are the last line of defense before bad code enters the repository
- Bypassing hooks can introduce broken code into main branch
- Broken code in main blocks other developers and CI/CD pipeline
- Trust in the development process is built on consistent quality gates

### RULE 4: Follow Existing Patterns

- Study existing code before adding new features
- Use the same patterns and conventions
- Don't introduce new dependencies without need

### RULE 5: PARALLEL AGENT EXECUTION

**USE 3-5 AGENTS IN PARALLEL** for complex tasks:

- **Domain-Parallel**: Multi-domain requirements executed simultaneously
- **Pipeline-Parallel**: Sequential streams with parallel stages
- **Investigation-Parallel**: Parallel analysis with consolidated resolution

**REFERENCE**: See CLAUDE-agents.md for patterns and agent selection

### RULE 6: BDD Coverage Guarantee (CRITICAL)

**Every scenario in .feature files MUST have corresponding automated test.**

**Available Commands:**
```bash
npm run bdd:coverage    # Show current BDD coverage
npm run bdd:report      # Generate detailed Markdown report
npm run bdd:check       # Fail if coverage < 80% threshold
```

**Before adding new scenario:**
1. Write the scenario in `.feature` file (specs/features/)
2. Implement the corresponding test (tests/component/ or tests/ui/)
3. Run `npm run bdd:coverage` to verify coverage
4. Update `coverage-mapping.json` if auto-detection fails

**Before committing:**
```bash
npm run bdd:check  # Must pass (‚â•80% coverage)
```

**Naming Conventions:**
- Test description should contain keywords from scenario name
- Use descriptive test names that match scenario intent
- Manual mapping via `coverage-mapping.json` for complex cases

**Example:**

Feature file (`specs/features/layout/table-sorting.feature`):
```gherkin
Scenario: First click - sort ascending
  When I click on header "Name"
  Then table is sorted ascending
  And header "Name" contains symbol "‚ñ≤"
```

Test file (`tests/component/AssetRelationsTable.spec.tsx`):
```typescript
test('should handle sorting by name', async ({ mount }) => {
  const component = await mount(<AssetRelationsTable relations={mockRelations} />);

  await component.locator('th:has-text("Name")').click();
  await expect(component.locator('th:has-text("Name")')).toContainText('‚Üë');
});
```

**Manual Mapping** (`coverage-mapping.json`):
```json
{
  "table-sorting.feature": {
    "First click - sort ascending": {
      "tests": [
        "tests/component/AssetRelationsTable.spec.tsx::should handle sorting by name"
      ],
      "status": "covered"
    }
  }
}
```

**Coverage Threshold:**
- Minimum: 80% (enforced by `bdd:check`)
- Target: 100%
- Current threshold set via: `BDD_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD=80`

**Why this is critical:**
- Feature files serve as living documentation
- Prevents scenario/test drift
- Ensures every requirement is tested
- Enables BDD-driven development

### Error Resolution Patterns

```typescript
// Result pattern usage
const assetResult = Asset.create(props);
if (!assetResult.isSuccess) {
  console.error(assetResult.getError());
  return;
}

// Graceful degradation
if (!layoutFile) {
  await this.renderDefaultLayout(dv, file, metadata, container);
  return;
}
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tests failing**: Check mock setup in `__mocks__/obsidian.ts`
2. **Build errors**: Run `npm run build` for detailed output
3. **Coverage low**: Add tests for uncovered branches
4. **Release failed**: Check GitHub Actions logs
5. **E2E tests timeout**: Verify CSS selectors match actual rendered classes in screenshots
6. **E2E environment differences**: Check all dependencies available in Docker (Dataview, etc.)
7. **Obsolete dependency checks**: Audit code for unused plugin availability checks that block functionality

### E2E Testing Lessons Learned

Critical lessons from v12.15.45-49 debugging session (5 versions, 4 failures before success):

#### 1. Screenshot Analysis is Critical

**Lesson**: E2E test screenshots show actual rendered state - don't assume plugin is broken just because tests fail.

**Example**: v12.15.47 screenshots proved plugin rendered perfectly (Properties + DailyNote tasks tables visible), but tests failed with timeout. Problem was wrong CSS selector, not broken plugin.

**Action**:
- Always check E2E screenshots first when tests fail
- Compare expected vs. actual rendered output
- Use screenshots to validate assumptions about plugin behavior

#### 2. Code Analysis > Trial and Error

**Lesson**: Reading source code finds root cause faster than experimenting with fixes.

**Example**: After 3 failed attempts (config, UI clicks, timing), analyzed `UniversalLayoutRenderer.ts` source code and discovered `.exocortex-layout-container` CSS class **never existed** in the codebase.

**Action**:
- Read the actual source code that creates DOM elements
- Verify CSS classes, selectors, and element structure
- Don't guess - check the implementation directly
- Use `grep -r "class-name"` to find where selectors are created

#### 3. Obsolete Dependencies Kill

**Lesson**: Code evolves but old dependency checks remain, blocking functionality in different environments.

**Example**: `renderDailyTasks` checked for Dataview plugin availability (9 lines of code) but hasn't used Dataview API since v12.x. In E2E Docker (no Dataview), method returned early without rendering `.exocortex-daily-tasks-section`, causing test timeouts.

**Action**:
- Regular audit of dependency availability checks
- Verify checks are actually needed for functionality
- Remove obsolete checks when code evolves
- Document required vs. optional dependencies clearly

#### 4. E2E Environment ‚â† Production

**Lesson**: Docker test environment lacks optional plugins, creating different code paths than production.

**Example**: Plugin worked perfectly in production with Dataview installed, but failed in E2E Docker without Dataview because of obsolete availability check.

**Action**:
- Explicitly test both environments (with/without optional plugins)
- Mock or install required dependencies in E2E Docker
- Remove environment-specific code paths when possible
- Document environment differences in test README

#### 5. CSS Selector Validation

**Lesson**: Always verify CSS selectors exist in actual rendered output before writing tests.

**Example**: Tests waited for `.exocortex-layout-container` selector that plugin never created. Should have been `.exocortex-daily-tasks-section` or `.exocortex-properties-section`.

**Action**:
- Use browser DevTools or E2E screenshots to verify selectors
- Check source code for actual CSS class names
- Update tests when component structure changes
- Keep test selectors in sync with implementation

**Quick Reference - Actual CSS Classes Created by Plugin**:
```typescript
// From UniversalLayoutRenderer.ts:
exocortex-buttons-section          // line 439
exocortex-properties-section       // line 1072
exocortex-daily-tasks-section      // line 1149
exocortex-assets-relations         // line 1196
// NOTE: .exocortex-layout-container does NOT exist!
```
