# Claude Code Work State

## Current Session
- **Date**: 2025-01-19
- **Session Start**: Task continuation from previous work
- **Primary Focus**: Test suite stabilization and state persistence implementation

## Current Work Progress

### Active Task
- **Task**: Verifying test fixes and preparing final commit
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Progress**: 85%
- **Next Steps**: Final test validation and commit

### Session Tasks Completed
1. ✅ Analyzed git status and recent commits
2. ✅ Reviewed CLAUDE-errors.md for unresolved issues
3. ✅ Fixed jest configuration conflict (--maxWorkers vs --runInBand)
4. ✅ Created state-persistence-agent for automatic work tracking
5. ✅ Used meta-agent to coordinate parallel agent execution
6. ✅ Fixed RDFService test failures (from 30 to 6 failures)
7. ✅ Applied memory optimizations for test execution

### Pending Tasks
1. ⏳ Run full test suite and ensure all tests pass
2. ⏳ Verify mobile test stability
3. ⏳ Check CI/CD pipeline status

## Important Decisions

### Decision Log
1. **Jest Configuration Fix**: Removed conflicting --maxWorkers option to use --runInBand for memory optimization
2. **State Persistence**: Implemented automatic state tracking to prevent work loss between sessions
3. **Test Strategy**: Focus on memory-safe execution patterns for CI environments

## Files Modified This Session

### Modified Files
- `package.json`: Fixed jest test:unit command configuration
- `.claude/agents/state-persistence-agent.md`: Created new agent for state persistence
- `CLAUDE-state.md`: Created state tracking file (this file)

## Error Patterns Resolved

### Resolved Issues
1. **Jest Command Conflict**: Both --runInBand and --maxWorkers specified
   - Solution: Removed --maxWorkers, kept --runInBand for sequential execution

## Environment Status

### Test Suite Status
- **Last Known Status**: 93% pass rate (1906/2047 tests passing)
- **Memory Issues**: RESOLVED (per CLAUDE-errors.md)
- **Mobile Tests**: 8 test suites with failures (under development)

### Git Status
- **Branch**: main
- **Modified Files**: 
  - jest.config.js
  - package.json
  - tests/integration/PropertyEditingUseCase.test.ts
  - tests/mobile-setup.ts
  - tests/unit/application/use-cases/PropertyEditingUseCase.test.ts
  - tests/unit/domain/semantic/IndexedGraphBenchmark.test.ts
  - tests/unit/presentation/mobile/TouchGraphController.test.ts
- **Untracked Files**:
  - CLAUDE-errors.md
  - scripts/run-tests-memory-safe.sh
  - tests/memory-optimization-setup.ts
  - tests/test-cleanup.ts
  - CLAUDE-state.md (now tracked)

## Next Actions

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Run `npm test` to validate test suite status
2. Address any remaining test failures
3. Commit changes if tests pass
4. Update version and release if appropriate

### Recovery Instructions
If continuing this session:
1. Check test status with `npm test`
2. Review any new errors in console output
3. Continue with pending tasks from todo list
4. Update this state file with progress

## Session Notes

### Key Observations
- Memory optimization measures from previous work appear successful
- Test infrastructure is stabilized with proper cleanup patterns
- Mobile test failures are expected (features under development)
- State persistence now implemented for better work continuity

### Technical Context
- Using Jest with memory optimization flags
- Clean Architecture patterns throughout codebase
- 26 specialized agents available for complex tasks
- Comprehensive test patterns documented in CLAUDE-test-patterns.md
