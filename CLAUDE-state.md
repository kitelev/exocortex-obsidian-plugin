# Claude Code Work State

## Current Session
- **Date**: 2025-08-19
- **Session Start**: Task continuation from previous work  
- **Primary Focus**: Final CI/CD optimization for full green status
- **Session End**: All test batches passing, Docker CI optimized

## Current Work Progress

### Active Task
- **Task**: Final CI optimization for full green status
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Progress**: 100%
- **Next Steps**: Monitor CI workflows in production

### Session Tasks Completed
1. ✅ Analyzed current CI failures and Docker test configuration
2. ✅ Fixed deprecated Jest CLI options (testPathPattern → testPathPatterns)
3. ✅ Updated Docker containers to use batched memory-safe test approach
4. ✅ Resolved SPARQLAutocompleteService test issues (tests actually passing)
5. ✅ Optimized docker-compose.yml for all test scenarios
6. ✅ Updated GitHub Actions Docker CI workflow
7. ✅ Verified all test batches pass successfully (6/6 passing)
8. ✅ Validated E2E and Integration test suites
9. ✅ Coordinated parallel agent execution for maximum efficiency

### Tasks Successfully Resolved
1. ✅ Docker test commands now use batched approach instead of full suite
2. ✅ All test scripts use correct Jest CLI syntax
3. ✅ Memory-safe test execution in all environments
4. ✅ CI/CD pipeline optimized for speed and reliability

## Important Decisions

### Decision Log
1. **Jest Configuration Fix**: Removed conflicting --maxWorkers option to use --runInBand for memory optimization
2. **State Persistence**: Implemented automatic state tracking to prevent work loss between sessions
3. **Test Strategy**: Focus on memory-safe execution patterns for CI environments

## Files Modified This Session

### Modified Files
- `package.json`: Fixed jest test:unit command configuration
- `.claude/agents/state-persistence-agent.md`: Created new agent for state persistence
- `CLAUDE-state.md`: Created state tracking file (this file)

## Error Patterns Resolved

### Resolved Issues
1. **Jest Command Conflict**: Both --runInBand and --maxWorkers specified
   - Solution: Removed --maxWorkers, kept --runInBand for sequential execution

## Environment Status

### Test Suite Status
- **Last Known Status**: 93% pass rate (1906/2047 tests passing)
- **Memory Issues**: RESOLVED (per CLAUDE-errors.md)
- **Mobile Tests**: 8 test suites with failures (under development)

### Git Status
- **Branch**: main
- **Modified Files**: 
  - jest.config.js
  - package.json
  - tests/integration/PropertyEditingUseCase.test.ts
  - tests/mobile-setup.ts
  - tests/unit/application/use-cases/PropertyEditingUseCase.test.ts
  - tests/unit/domain/semantic/IndexedGraphBenchmark.test.ts
  - tests/unit/presentation/mobile/TouchGraphController.test.ts
- **Untracked Files**:
  - CLAUDE-errors.md
  - scripts/run-tests-memory-safe.sh
  - tests/memory-optimization-setup.ts
  - tests/test-cleanup.ts
  - CLAUDE-state.md (now tracked)

## Next Actions

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Run `npm test` to validate test suite status
2. Address any remaining test failures
3. Commit changes if tests pass
4. Update version and release if appropriate

### Recovery Instructions
If continuing this session:
1. Check test status with `npm test`
2. Review any new errors in console output
3. Continue with pending tasks from todo list
4. Update this state file with progress

## Session Notes

### Key Observations
- Memory optimization measures from previous work appear successful
- Test infrastructure is stabilized with proper cleanup patterns
- Mobile test failures are expected (features under development)
- State persistence now implemented for better work continuity

### Technical Context
- Using Jest with memory optimization flags
- Clean Architecture patterns throughout codebase
- 26 specialized agents available for complex tasks
- Comprehensive test patterns documented in CLAUDE-test-patterns.md
