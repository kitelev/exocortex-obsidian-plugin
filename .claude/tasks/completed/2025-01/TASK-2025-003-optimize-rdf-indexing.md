## Description

Optimize the RDF triple store indexing to handle large vaults (>1000 notes) efficiently. Current implementation may have O(n) lookups that should be O(1).

## Current Performance

- Vault with 100 notes: ~50ms indexing
- Vault with 1000 notes: ~2000ms indexing (not linear!)
- Query performance degrades with size

## Target Performance

- Vault with 1000 notes: <500ms indexing
- Vault with 10000 notes: <5000ms indexing
- Consistent O(1) lookup times

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Implement proper SPO/POS/OSP indexing
- [x] Add performance benchmarks
- [x] Document complexity improvements
- [x] Maintain backward compatibility
- [x] Update architecture documentation

## Completion Notes

Created IndexedGraph class with full SPO/POS/OSP triple indexing, batch operations, caching, and performance metrics. O(1) lookups achieved.

## Technical Approach

1. Review current IndexedGraph implementation
2. Optimize index structures
3. Add caching where appropriate
4. Implement lazy loading
5. Add performance tests
