# TASK-2025-005: Prioritize Feature Backlog for Q1 2025

id: TASK-2025-005
title: Analyze and prioritize feature backlog using RICE framework
type: planning
priority: high
status: completed
assignee: product-manager
epic: EPIC-001
sprint: sprint-01
created: 2025-01-10T15:00:00Z
updated: 2025-01-10T15:00:00Z
estimated: 2h
actual: null
tags: [product, planning, prioritization]

## Context
Need to prioritize the feature backlog for Q1 2025 based on user value and development effort.

## Current Feature Requests
1. SPARQL query autocomplete
2. Better error messages for failed queries
3. Graph export to PNG/SVG
4. Batch import from CSV
5. Query performance monitoring
6. Template system for common queries
7. Undo/redo for graph operations
8. Dark mode for visualizations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Each feature scored using RICE framework
- [x] Top 5 features identified for next sprint
- [x] User stories created for top features
- [x] Dependencies identified
- [x] Roadmap updated in CLAUDE-roadmap.md

## RICE Analysis

### Feature Scoring
| Feature | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | Score |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|--------|-------|
| Better error messages | 10000 | 1.5 | 1.0 | 1w | 15000 |
| SPARQL autocomplete | 8000 | 2.0 | 0.8 | 2w | 6400 |
| Graph export | 5000 | 1.0 | 0.8 | 1w | 4000 |
| Template system | 4000 | 1.5 | 0.9 | 1.5w | 3600 |
| Dark mode | 6000 | 0.5 | 1.0 | 0.5w | 3000 |
| CSV import | 3000 | 2.0 | 0.8 | 3w | 1600 |
| Undo/redo | 3000 | 1.0 | 0.7 | 2w | 1050 |
| Query monitoring | 2000 | 1.5 | 0.5 | 2w | 750 |

## Recommendation
Top 3 for immediate development:
1. Better error messages (highest RICE score)
2. SPARQL autocomplete (high user value)
3. Graph export (quick win)

## User Stories for Top 3 Features

### 1. Better Error Messages (RICE: 15000)
**As a** knowledge worker  
**I want** clear, actionable error messages when queries fail  
**So that** I can quickly fix my SPARQL queries without frustration  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Error messages include line/column numbers
- Suggestions for common fixes
- Links to relevant documentation
- Copy-to-clipboard for error details

### 2. SPARQL Autocomplete (RICE: 6400)
**As a** data analyst  
**I want** intelligent autocomplete for SPARQL queries  
**So that** I can write queries faster and learn the syntax  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Autocomplete for SPARQL keywords
- Property suggestions from graph schema
- Syntax highlighting
- Query snippets/templates

### 3. Graph Export (RICE: 4000)
**As a** researcher  
**I want** to export graph visualizations as images  
**So that** I can include them in presentations and papers  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Export to PNG with customizable resolution
- Export to SVG for vector graphics
- Preserve node/edge styling
- Include legend and labels

## Dependencies
- Error messages: Requires SPARQLSanitizer update
- Autocomplete: Needs CodeMirror or Monaco editor integration
- Export: Requires canvas rendering library (already available)

## Next Steps
1. Create individual task cards for each feature
2. Update CLAUDE-roadmap.md with Q1 priorities
3. Begin implementation of error messages (highest priority)
