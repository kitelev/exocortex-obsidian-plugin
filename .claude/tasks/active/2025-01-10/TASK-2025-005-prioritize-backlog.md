- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Roadmap updated in CLAUDE-roadmap.md

## RICE Analysis

### Feature Scoring
| Feature | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | Score |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|--------|-------|
| SPARQL autocomplete | 8000 | 2.0 | 0.8 | 2w | 6400 |
| Better error messages | 10000 | 1.5 | 1.0 | 1w | 15000 |
| Graph export | 5000 | 1.0 | 0.8 | 1w | 4000 |
| CSV import | 3000 | 2.0 | 0.8 | 3w | 1600 |
| Query monitoring | 2000 | 1.5 | 0.5 | 2w | 750 |

## Recommendation
Top 3 for immediate development:
1. Better error messages (highest RICE score)
2. SPARQL autocomplete (high user value)
3. Graph export (quick win)
