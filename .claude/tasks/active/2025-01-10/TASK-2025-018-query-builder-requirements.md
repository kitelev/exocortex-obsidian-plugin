# TASK-2025-018: Visual Query Builder Requirements Analysis

**Assigned Agent**: Product Manager + BABOK Agent  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Active  
**Created**: 2025-01-10  
**Deadline**: 2025-01-12  

## Objective
Define comprehensive requirements and user stories for the Visual Query Builder UI feature that will enable non-technical users to construct SPARQL queries through a drag-and-drop interface.

## Context
- Current system has text-based SPARQL query interface with autocomplete
- Users struggle with SPARQL syntax complexity
- Need visual alternative that generates proper SPARQL queries
- Must integrate with existing SPARQL infrastructure

## Requirements to Define

### Functional Requirements
1. **Visual Query Construction**
   - Drag-and-drop interface for query building
   - Pattern blocks (subject-predicate-object triples)
   - Query type selection (SELECT, CONSTRUCT, ASK)
   - Filter condition builder
   - Real-time SPARQL generation

2. **User Experience**
   - Progressive disclosure of complexity
   - Context-sensitive help and guidance
   - Validation and error prevention
   - Preview and query result display

3. **Integration Points**
   - Leverage existing autocomplete suggestions
   - Use current error handling system
   - Integrate with graph visualization
   - Export/import query templates

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Responsive UI, fast query generation
2. **Usability**: Intuitive for non-technical users
3. **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatible
4. **Maintainability**: Clean architecture, testable code

## User Stories to Create
- [ ] As a knowledge worker, I want to build queries visually so I don't need SPARQL expertise
- [ ] As a researcher, I want to filter results by properties so I can find specific data
- [ ] As a non-technical user, I want query templates so I can start with common patterns
- [ ] As a power user, I want to see the generated SPARQL so I can learn and modify

## Acceptance Criteria
- Complete functional requirements specification
- Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
- Use case scenarios for different user types
- Integration requirements with existing system
- UI/UX wireframes and interaction flows

## Dependencies
- Current SPARQL infrastructure analysis (QB-001) âœ“
- Existing autocomplete and error handling systems

## Deliverables
- Requirements specification document
- User story backlog with acceptance criteria
- Use case scenarios
- Business analysis report

## Agent Instructions
**Product Manager**: Focus on user needs, market validation, feature prioritization
**BABOK Agent**: Apply business analysis techniques, create formal requirements documentation, trace requirements to technical specifications
