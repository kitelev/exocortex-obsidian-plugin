# TASK-2025-009: Product Manager - Error Message User Stories

## Task Information
- **ID**: TASK-2025-009
- **Assigned Agent**: Product Manager
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Pending Assignment
- **Dependencies**: Error analysis complete
- **Estimated Effort**: 8 hours

## Context
The Better Error Messages feature is the highest priority item (RICE: 15000) for v2.11.0. Current error handling provides poor user experience with technical jargon and no actionable guidance.

## Objectives
Create comprehensive user stories that define exactly what users need when encountering errors in the Exocortex plugin.

## Deliverables

### 1. User Personas & Error Scenarios
- Define primary user types (beginner, intermediate, advanced SPARQL users)
- Map error scenarios by user persona
- Identify most frustrating error experiences

### 2. User Stories Collection
Create stories for each major error category:

#### SPARQL Syntax Errors
- As a beginner user, I want to understand what's wrong with my SPARQL query
- As an intermediate user, I want to see exactly where the syntax error occurred
- As an advanced user, I want detailed parsing information for complex queries

#### Security/Sanitization Errors
- As any user, I want to know why my query was blocked and how to fix it
- As a power user, I want to understand security implications of query patterns

#### Data Import/Export Errors
- As a user importing RDF, I want to know which lines contain invalid data
- As a user exporting data, I want to understand why certain triples failed

#### Asset Creation Errors
- As a user creating assets, I want immediate feedback on invalid field values
- As a user, I want to understand property constraints and requirements

### 3. Acceptance Criteria
For each user story, define:
- Success conditions
- Error message quality standards
- User satisfaction metrics
- Documentation requirements

### 4. Priority Matrix
- Rank error scenarios by frequency and user impact
- Define MVP vs. nice-to-have improvements
- Create implementation timeline recommendations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete user persona definitions
- [ ] 15+ detailed user stories covering all error categories
- [ ] Clear acceptance criteria for each story
- [ ] Validated priorities based on user research
- [ ] Integration plan with UX design requirements

## Resources
- Current error analysis: `.claude/analysis/BETTER-ERROR-MESSAGES-ANALYSIS.md`
- Existing user feedback in GitHub issues
- SPARQL specification for technical accuracy
- Obsidian plugin best practices documentation

## Next Agent Handoff
Upon completion, coordinate with:
- UX Designer Agent (for error message design patterns)
- SWEBOK Engineer Agent (for technical feasibility review)
- QA Engineer Agent (for testing story validation)

## Notes
Focus on user empathy and practical problem-solving. Error messages should educate users and build their confidence with SPARQL and RDF concepts.
