# Task: Product Manager - SPARQL Autocomplete Requirements

**Task ID**: TASK-2025-013
**Agent**: Product Manager
**Priority**: High
**Status**: pending
**Created**: 2025-01-10
**Deadline**: 2025-01-12

## Context

The Exocortex plugin needs SPARQL Autocomplete functionality to improve developer experience and reduce query errors. This is the next priority feature after Better Error Messages (v2.11.0).

**RICE Score**: 6400 (High Impact)
- **Reach**: 1000+ users writing SPARQL queries
- **Impact**: 8/10 (significantly improves usability)
- **Confidence**: 80% (proven pattern in IDEs)
- **Effort**: 1 (moderate complexity)

## User Research Insights

From analysis of current SPARQL usage:
- Users interact with SPARQL through markdown code blocks (```sparql)
- Current flow: Type query → Execute → Fix errors → Repeat
- Pain points: Manual typing of keywords, property names, variable names
- Success patterns: Templates and examples reduce errors significantly

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Keyword Completion**
   - Complete SPARQL keywords (SELECT, WHERE, FILTER, OPTIONAL, UNION, etc.)
   - Context-aware suggestions (e.g., only show ORDER BY after WHERE)
   - Support for SPARQL 1.1 functions and operators

2. **Property Suggestions**
   - Extract properties from current graph/triple store
   - Filter properties based on context (subject type)
   - Show property usage frequency/relevance

3. **Variable Name Suggestions**
   - Suggest meaningful variable names based on context
   - Re-use variable names from same query
   - Follow naming conventions (?subject, ?predicate, ?object, etc.)

4. **Query Templates**
   - Provide templates for common query patterns
   - Asset queries, relationship queries, ontology queries
   - Parameterized templates with placeholders

5. **Prefix/Namespace Completion**
   - Complete namespace prefixes (rdf:, rdfs:, owl:, exo:)
   - Show full namespace URIs in tooltips
   - Auto-add PREFIX declarations

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Suggestion response time < 100ms
   - No blocking of main UI thread
   - Efficient property/namespace caching

2. **User Experience**
   - Familiar autocomplete behavior (Ctrl+Space, arrow navigation)
   - Non-intrusive suggestions (don't interrupt typing flow)
   - Clear visual distinction between suggestion types

3. **Accessibility**
   - Keyboard-only navigation
   - Screen reader compatible
   - High contrast support

## User Stories

### Epic: SPARQL Query Assistance

**As a knowledge worker**
**I want intelligent autocomplete while writing SPARQL queries**
**So that I can write queries faster and with fewer errors**

#### Story 1: Keyword Completion
```
As a SPARQL user
I want keyword suggestions as I type
So that I don't need to memorize all SPARQL syntax

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Typing "SEL" shows "SELECT" suggestion
- [ ] Context-aware keywords (FILTER only after WHERE)
- [ ] Support for functions (CONCAT, REGEX, etc.)
```

#### Story 2: Property Discovery
```
As a knowledge manager
I want to see available properties for my data
So that I can discover relationships and build better queries

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Show properties from current graph
- [ ] Filter by subject type when possible
- [ ] Display property descriptions/labels
```

#### Story 3: Query Templates
```
As a new SPARQL user
I want query templates for common patterns
So that I can learn SPARQL while being productive

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Templates for asset queries, relationships, ontology
- [ ] Parameterized placeholders
- [ ] Template descriptions and examples
```

#### Story 4: Variable Assistance
```
As a SPARQL developer
I want smart variable name suggestions
So that my queries are readable and maintainable

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Suggest meaningful variable names
- [ ] Reuse variables within same query
- [ ] Follow SPARQL naming conventions
```

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Query Success Rate**: >90% (up from current ~75%)
- **Time to Working Query**: <2 minutes (down from current ~5 minutes)
- **User Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 stars in feedback

### Secondary Metrics
- **Autocomplete Usage Rate**: >80% of queries use suggestions
- **Template Adoption**: >50% of new users start with templates
- **Error Reduction**: 60% fewer syntax errors

## User Journey Map

### Current State (Before Autocomplete)
1. User opens markdown file
2. Creates ```sparql code block
3. Types query from memory/documentation
4. Executes and encounters errors
5. Debugs syntax issues
6. Repeats until working

**Pain Points**: Manual typing, syntax errors, property discovery

### Future State (With Autocomplete)
1. User opens markdown file
2. Creates ```sparql code block
3. Starts typing - immediately sees suggestions
4. Selects keywords, properties, templates
5. Executes working query on first try
6. Focuses on query logic, not syntax

**Improvements**: Guided typing, error prevention, faster iteration

## Feature Prioritization (MoSCoW)

### Must Have (MVP)
- Keyword completion (SELECT, WHERE, basic functions)
- Property suggestions from current graph
- Basic variable name suggestions
- Prefix completion (rdf:, rdfs:, owl:, exo:)

### Should Have
- Query templates for common patterns
- Context-aware suggestions
- Property filtering by subject type
- Function parameter hints

### Could Have
- Advanced template customization
- Query history integration
- Cross-query variable sharing
- Performance suggestions

### Won't Have (This Release)
- Visual query builder
- Natural language to SPARQL
- Advanced semantic validation
- Multi-user collaboration features

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Current SPARQL processing architecture
- Graph/triple store access for property extraction
- Obsidian editor integration APIs

### Business Dependencies
- Better Error Messages feature (v2.11.0) completion
- User feedback from current SPARQL users
- Documentation updates for new features

## Risks and Mitigation

### High Risk
- **Performance Impact**: Autocomplete might slow down typing
  - **Mitigation**: Async suggestions, debouncing, caching

### Medium Risk
- **Complex Integration**: Obsidian editor APIs might be limiting
  - **Mitigation**: Research editor extensions, fallback approaches

### Low Risk
- **User Adoption**: Users might not use autocomplete
  - **Mitigation**: Smart defaults, user education, progressive disclosure

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All user stories implemented and tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<100ms response time)
- [ ] Accessibility requirements satisfied
- [ ] Documentation updated (user guide, developer docs)
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed (>4.5/5 satisfaction)
- [ ] A/B testing shows significant improvement in success metrics

## Next Steps

1. **Architect Agent**: Design autocomplete engine architecture
2. **UX Designer**: Create interface mockups and interaction patterns
3. **SWEBOK Engineer**: Implement core autocomplete functionality
4. **QA Engineer**: Develop comprehensive testing strategy
5. **Technical Writer**: Prepare user documentation

## Notes

This feature builds on the success of Better Error Messages by proactively preventing errors rather than just improving error reporting. The combination should create a significantly better SPARQL authoring experience.

Focus on incremental value - even basic keyword completion will be valuable, so we can iterate and enhance based on user feedback.
