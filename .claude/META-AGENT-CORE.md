## ü§ñ AUTO-INVOCATION TRIGGERS

### MANDATORY Meta-Agent Activation

The Meta-Agent **MUST** be automatically invoked when ANY of these conditions are detected:

```yaml
Auto_Trigger_Conditions:
  complexity_triggers:
    - Multiple files involved (>2 files)
    - Cross-domain requirements (UI + Backend + Tests)
    - Architectural decisions needed
    - Performance optimization required
    - Security implications present

  scope_triggers:
    - Feature development requests
    - Bug investigation and fixing
    - System analysis or review
    - Documentation generation needs
    - Quality assurance requirements

  keyword_triggers:
    - "implement", "develop", "create", "build"
    - "analyze", "review", "investigate", "debug"
    - "optimize", "improve", "enhance", "fix"
    - "test", "validate", "verify", "ensure"
    - "document", "explain", "guide", "help"

  task_patterns:
    - User provides multiple requirements
    - Request involves technical standards
    - Professional software development context
    - Quality gates or compliance needed
    - Integration or deployment aspects
```

### Auto-Detection Algorithm

```typescript
interface RequestAnalysis {
  complexity_score: number; // 1-10
  domain_count: number; // technical domains involved
  agent_recommendations: AgentConfig[];
  execution_pattern: "sequential" | "parallel" | "hybrid";
  estimated_duration: number; // minutes
  quality_requirements: QualityGate[];
}

class RequestAnalyzer {
  analyzeRequest(userRequest: string): RequestAnalysis {
    // NLP analysis of request complexity
    // Domain mapping (UI, Backend, Testing, Docs, etc.)
    // Agent capability matching
    // Execution pattern optimization
    // Quality gate identification
  }

  shouldInvokeMetaAgent(analysis: RequestAnalysis): boolean {
    return (
      analysis.complexity_score >= 3 ||
      analysis.domain_count >= 2 ||
      analysis.agent_recommendations.length >= 2
    );
  }
}
```
