### PHASE 4: QUALITY GATES & VALIDATION

[Continues with existing Stage 2-5 from original execute.md]

### INTERACTIVE WORKFLOW EXAMPLE:

```typescript
// Pseudo-code for enhanced execution flow
async function executeEnhanced(task: string) {
  // Phase 0: Requirements Gathering
  console.log("🎯 Starting BABOK Requirements Interview...");
  const babokAgent = await deployAgent('babok-agent');
  
  const requirements = await babokAgent.conductInterview({
    initialTask: task,
    interviewMode: 'comprehensive',
    questions: [
      "What problem are you trying to solve?",
      "What are the expected outcomes?",
      "Are there any specific constraints?",
      "How will success be measured?"
    ]
  });
  
  // User confirmation point
  console.log("📋 Requirements Summary:");
  console.log(requirements.summary);
  const approved = await getUserConfirmation("Do these requirements look correct?");
  
  if (!approved) {
    return babokAgent.refineRequirements();
  }
  
  // Phase 1: Project Planning
  console.log("📊 Starting PMBOK Project Planning...");
  const pmbokAgent = await deployAgent('pmbok-agent');
  
  const projectPlan = await pmbokAgent.createProjectPlan({
    requirements: requirements,
    includeWBS: true,
    riskAnalysis: true,
    resourcePlanning: true
  });
  
  // Phase 2: Engineering Design
  console.log("🔧 Starting SWEBOK Engineering Design...");
  const swebokAgent = await deployAgent('swebok-engineer');
  
  const engineeringDesign = await swebokAgent.designSolution({
    requirements: requirements,
    projectPlan: projectPlan,
    architectureLevel: 'detailed',
    includeADRs: true
  });
  
  // Phase 3: Parallel Execution
  console.log("🚀 Deploying Implementation Agents...");
  const orchestrator = await deployAgent('orchestrator');
  
  await orchestrator.executeParallel({
    design: engineeringDesign,
    agents: selectAgentsFromDesign(engineeringDesign),
    monitoring: 'real-time',
    conflictResolution: 'automatic'
  });
  
  // Continue with existing quality gates and release process...
}
```

### CONSOLE INTERACTION EXAMPLE:

```
$ /execute-enhanced Add a new feature for tracking user metrics

🎯 Starting BABOK Requirements Interview...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📝 Hello! I'm the BABOK agent. Let me help you define clear requirements.

Q1: What specific metrics do you want to track?
> [User types: page views, time spent, feature usage]

Q2: How should these metrics be stored?
> [User types: in a local database, exportable to CSV]

Q3: What visualizations do you need?
> [User types: charts and graphs, daily/weekly/monthly views]

Q4: Are there any privacy considerations?
> [User types: yes, all data must be anonymous and local-only]

Q5: What are your success criteria?
> [User types: accurate tracking, <100ms performance impact, easy export]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 Requirements Summary:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

### BENEFITS OF ENHANCED APPROACH:

1. **Requirements Clarity**: No ambiguity about what needs to be built
2. **User Alignment**: Explicit confirmation before implementation
3. **Structured Planning**: PMBOK ensures nothing is missed
4. **Engineering Excellence**: SWEBOK guarantees best practices
5. **Traceability**: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing
6. **Risk Mitigation**: Issues identified early in planning phase
7. **Quality Assurance**: Built into every phase, not bolted on

### FALLBACK TO STANDARD EXECUTION:

If user wants to skip requirements gathering:
```
$ /execute --skip-requirements [task]
```

This will use the original execute.md flow for quick tasks.

### CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:

```yaml
execution_modes:
  comprehensive:  # Full BABOK → PMBOK → SWEBOK → Implementation
    for: [features, major-changes, complex-bugs]
  
  standard:  # Original execute.md flow
    for: [quick-fixes, minor-updates, documentation]
  
  emergency:  # Skip planning, direct to implementation
    for: [critical-bugs, hotfixes]
    requires: explicit-flag
```
