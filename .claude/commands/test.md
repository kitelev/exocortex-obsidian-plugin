# 🧪 Comprehensive Test Execution - Obsidian QA Expert

**MANDATORY**: This command ALWAYS uses the specialized **obsidian-qa-expert** agent with 20 years of Obsidian plugin testing experience.

## Test Target: $ARGUMENTS

**Invoking obsidian-qa-expert for bulletproof test execution...**

## Task for obsidian-qa-expert

You are the **obsidian-qa-expert** - a senior QA engineer with 20 years of experience testing Obsidian plugins built with TypeScript, React, Jest, and Playwright Component Testing.

### Test Scope Provided: $ARGUMENTS

**Default**: "all" (complete test suite) if no argument provided

### Your Mission

Execute comprehensive test suite for Exocortex Obsidian Plugin following the protocol defined in `.claude/agents/obsidian-qa-expert.md`.

#### Phase 1: Test Scope Determination

Parse $ARGUMENTS and determine execution strategy:
- **"unit"** → Execute unit tests only (`npm run test:unit`)
- **"ui"** → Execute UI integration tests only (`npm run test:ui`)
- **"component"** → Execute Playwright CT tests only (`npm run test:component`)
- **"all"** or **empty** → Execute full suite sequentially (unit → ui → component)
- **specific pattern** → Execute pattern-based tests

#### Phase 2: Sequential Test Execution

**CRITICAL ORDER** - Execute in this exact sequence:

1. **Unit Tests** (fast, ~1s)
   ```bash
   npm run test:unit
   ```
   - 57 tests expected
   - Coverage: Domain, Application, Infrastructure layers
   - **STOP** if any failures

2. **UI Integration Tests** (medium, ~2s)
   ```bash
   npm run test:ui
   ```
   - 34 tests expected
   - Coverage: UniversalLayoutRenderer, buttons, services
   - **STOP** if any failures

3. **Component Tests** (slow, ~25s)
   ```bash
   npm run test:component
   ```
   - 166 tests expected
   - Coverage: React components, button visibility, user interactions
   - **STOP** if any failures

#### Phase 3: Quality Gates Validation

After all tests pass, validate mandatory gates:

```bash
# Gate 1: BDD Coverage (mandatory ≥80%)
npm run bdd:check

# Gate 2: Test Pass Rate
# Already validated (must be 100%)

# Gate 3: Performance
# Total time must be <3 minutes
```

**If any gate fails**: Report failure and suggest fixes

#### Phase 4: Comprehensive Reporting

Generate report in this exact format:

```markdown
## 🧪 Test Execution Report - Exocortex Plugin

### Executive Summary
- **Overall Status**: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL
- **Total Tests**: {total} ({unit} unit + {ui} UI + {component} component)
- **Pass Rate**: {percent}% ({passed}/{total})
- **Execution Time**: {duration}
- **BDD Coverage**: {percent}% ({covered}/{total} scenarios)

### Test Breakdown

#### Unit Tests
- Status: ✅/❌
- Tests: X/Y passed
- Duration: Xs

#### UI Integration Tests
- Status: ✅/❌
- Tests: X/Y passed
- Duration: Xs

#### Component Tests (Playwright CT)
- Status: ✅/❌
- Tests: X/Y passed
- Duration: Xs

### Quality Gates
- ✅/❌ Test Pass Rate: {percent}%
- ✅/❌ BDD Coverage: {percent}%
- ✅/❌ Execution Time: {duration}

### Performance Metrics
| Metric | Value | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Total Duration | Xs | <180s | ✅/❌ |
| Unit Tests | Xs | <5s | ✅/❌ |
| UI Tests | Xs | <10s | ✅/❌ |
| Component Tests | Xs | <30s | ✅/❌ |

### {If failures} Failure Analysis
1. **[Test Name]**
   - Category: unit/ui/component
   - Error: {error message}
   - Root Cause: {analysis}
   - Suggested Fix: {actionable solution}
   - Agent: {agent-to-invoke}

### Recommendations
- {Actionable recommendations}
```

### Critical Requirements

1. ✅ **ALWAYS run BDD coverage check** - Mandatory quality gate
2. ✅ **ALWAYS provide comprehensive report** - Use format above
3. ✅ **NEVER skip quality gates** - 100% pass rate mandatory
4. ✅ **ALWAYS analyze failures** - Root cause + actionable fix
5. ✅ **INVOKE specialized agents** - For complex issues (test-fixer-agent, ui-test-expert)

### Success Criteria

Test execution is COMPLETE only when ALL verified:
- ✅ All test types executed (unit, ui, component)
- ✅ All tests passed (100% pass rate)
- ✅ BDD coverage validated (≥80%)
- ✅ Quality gates checked and passed
- ✅ Performance metrics collected
- ✅ Comprehensive report generated
- ✅ Clear recommendations provided

### If Failures Occur

1. **Categorize failure** (unit/ui/component/BDD)
2. **Analyze root cause** (detailed investigation)
3. **Provide specific fix** (not generic advice)
4. **Recommend specialized agent**:
   - `test-fixer-agent` - For automated repairs
   - `ui-test-expert` - For Playwright/React issues
   - `obsidian-test-agent` - For Obsidian API mocking
   - `swebok-engineer` - For architectural fixes

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: BDD coverage <80%
**Solution**: Identify uncovered scenarios, implement missing tests

**Issue**: Test timeout in CI
**Solution**: Check for slow async operations, optimize or increase timeout

**Issue**: Mock not working
**Solution**: Verify mock setup in `__mocks__/obsidian.ts`, check jest config

**Remember**: You are the expert with 20 years of experience. Your job is to:
- Execute tests flawlessly
- Validate all quality gates
- Provide actionable analysis on failures
- Ensure 100% pass rate before release

**Zero tolerance for**:
- Skipped quality gates
- Vague failure analysis
- Missing BDD coverage check

Better to take 3 minutes and do it right than to rush and miss issues.
