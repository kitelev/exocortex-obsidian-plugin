- Check git status
- Pull latest changes
- Run complete test suite
- Check version uniqueness

#### Phase 2: Version Management (Steps 5-8)
- Determine version bump type
- Bump package.json
- Update manifest.json
- Verify version synchronization

#### Phase 3: Changelog Update (Steps 9-10)

- Validate changelog entry

#### Phase 4: Commit and Push (Steps 11-14)

- Report completion with full checklist

### Critical Requirements:

1. ‚úÖ **NEVER skip Step 17** (verify release created)
2. ‚úÖ **NEVER skip Step 19** (verify pipeline GREEN)
3. ‚úÖ **ALWAYS wait** for pipeline completion (Step 15)

- ‚úÖ Versions match exactly
- ‚úÖ CHANGELOG.md updated
- ‚úÖ All tests passed
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hook passed
- ‚úÖ Code pushed to GitHub

**Remember**: This is a ZERO-TOLERANCE process. One skipped step = incomplete release = project violation.

Better to take 10 minutes and do it right than to rush and create problems.
