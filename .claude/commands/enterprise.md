# ENTERPRISE EXECUTION ENGINE v2.0

## Task: $ARGUMENTS

## 🚀 PRODUCTION-READY ORCHESTRATION

**REAL EXECUTION ENGINE**: This command uses the actual Enterprise Orchestrator with live agent deployment, monitoring, and quality gates.

I'll execute your task using the enhanced Enterprise Execution Engine with:
- ✅ Real agent integration and parallel execution
- ✅ Live progress monitoring with visual feedback
- ✅ Automated quality gates and testing
- ✅ TodoWrite integration for progress tracking
- ✅ Production deliverables and comprehensive reporting

Let me run the enterprise orchestration system now:

```bash
node .claude/engines/integration-wrapper.js "$ARGUMENTS"
```

## 🎯 ENTERPRISE EXECUTION RESULTS

The system will provide:
1. **Real-time monitoring** with live progress updates
2. **Agent deployment** from `.claude/agents/` directory  
3. **Quality gate validation** with automated testing
4. **TodoWrite integration** for progress tracking
5. **Production deliverables** with comprehensive reporting

### 🎯 PHASE 0: MANDATORY BDD EXECUTABLE SPECIFICATIONS

**🚨 CRITICAL: ALL CODE CHANGES REQUIRE BDD SCENARIOS FIRST**

This phase is **MANDATORY** and **BLOCKING** - no code can be written without completing executable specifications.

#### Stage 0.1: BDD Scenario Development

**Deploy Senior BDD Specialist (20+ years experience):**

```yaml
Senior_BDD_Specialist:
  agent: bdd-requirements-agent
  experience_level: senior_20_years
  certifications: [ISTQB-ATAE, CBAP, Cucumber-Certified]
  
  executable_specifications:
    gherkin_syntax:
      - Feature: High-level business capability
      - Scenario: Specific behavior example
      - Given: Initial context/state
      - When: Action/event that triggers behavior
      - Then: Expected outcome/result
      - And/But: Additional conditions
    
    coverage_requirements:
      - Happy path scenarios (primary flows)
      - Edge cases (boundary conditions)
      - Error scenarios (exception handling)

  exocortex_plugin_examples:
    rdf_triple_management:
      feature: |
        Feature: RDF Triple Management
          As a knowledge worker
          I want to manage RDF triples in my vault
          So that I can build a semantic knowledge graph
        
        Scenario: Adding a valid RDF triple
          Given I have an empty RDF graph
          When I add a triple with subject "ex:Person1", predicate "ex:hasName", and object "John Doe"
          Then the triple should be stored in the graph
          And the graph should contain exactly 1 triple
          And I should be able to query for the triple
        
        Scenario: Rejecting invalid RDF triple
          Given I have an RDF graph
          When I attempt to add a triple with invalid IRI format
          Then the system should reject the triple
          And display an appropriate error message
          And the graph should remain unchanged
        
        Scenario: Querying RDF triples by subject
          Given I have a graph with 5 triples for subject "ex:Person1"
          And I have 3 triples for subject "ex:Person2"
          When I query for all triples with subject "ex:Person1"
          Then I should receive exactly 5 triples
          And all returned triples should have "ex:Person1" as subject
    
    obsidian_integration:
      feature: |
        Feature: Obsidian Vault Integration
          As an Obsidian user
          I want the plugin to automatically extract semantic data from my notes
          So that my knowledge graph reflects my vault content
        
        Scenario: Processing new note with semantic content
          Given I have an empty vault
          When I create a note with YAML frontmatter containing "type: Person"
          And the note content contains "[[John Doe]] works at [[Acme Corp]]"
          Then the system should extract 2 entities
          And create appropriate RDF triples for the relationships
          And the knowledge graph should be updated automatically
        
        Scenario: Handling note deletion
          Given I have a note that contributed 3 triples to the graph
          When I delete the note
          Then the 3 triples should be removed from the graph
          And the graph statistics should be updated
          And no orphaned data should remain
    
    query_engine_abstraction:
      feature: |
        Feature: Query Engine Abstraction
          As a developer
          I want to use different query engines interchangeably
          So that the system can adapt to available technologies
        
        Scenario: Dataview engine availability
          Given Dataview plugin is installed and active
          When I initialize the query engine factory
          Then it should detect Dataview as available
          And create a DataviewQueryEngine instance
          And the engine should pass basic query tests
        
        Scenario: Fallback to native engine
          Given no query engine plugins are available
          When I initialize the query engine factory
          Then it should fall back to the native engine
          And the native engine should handle basic queries
          And maintain data consistency
    
    mobile_optimization:
      feature: |
        Feature: Mobile Performance Optimization
          As a mobile Obsidian user
          I want the plugin to work smoothly on my device
          So that I can access my knowledge graph anywhere
        
        Scenario: Touch gesture recognition
          Given I'm using Obsidian on a touch device
          When I perform a pinch gesture on the graph view
          Then the graph should zoom appropriately
          And the zoom should be smooth and responsive
          And zoom limits should be respected
        
        Scenario: Adaptive batch processing
          Given I'm on a mobile device with limited resources
          When the system processes a large number of notes
          Then it should use smaller batch sizes
          And show progress indicators
          And maintain UI responsiveness

│   Given the user "john.doe@company.com" exists in the system   │
│   When the user attempts to login with correct password        │
│   Then the user should be successfully authenticated           │
│   And a JWT token should be generated                          │
│   And the session should be established                        │

│ Scenario: Multi-factor authentication requirement              │
│   Given MFA is enabled for user "admin@company.com"           │
│   When the user provides valid username and password          │
│   Then the system should request MFA verification             │

│   Then the account should be locked for 30 minutes            │
│   And a security alert should be triggered                    │
│   And the attempt should be logged for audit                  │
│                                                                 │
│ Scenario: SSO integration with enterprise directory           │
│   Given the user exists in Active Directory                   │
│   When they access the system via SSO provider                │
│   Then authentication should be delegated to AD               │
│   And user roles should be synchronized                       │

### ⚡ PHASE 11: MANDATORY RELEASE & DEPLOYMENT

**🚨 CRITICAL: NO TASK IS COMPLETE WITHOUT SUCCESSFUL RELEASE**

#### Stage 11.1: Release Preparation

```yaml
Release_Preparation:
  agent: release-agent
  mandatory: true
  blocking: true
  
  pre_release_checklist:
    - ✅ All tests passing
    - ✅ Build successful  
    - ✅ Coverage thresholds met
    - ✅ No linting errors
    - ✅ Documentation updated
  
  release_steps:
    1. Update version in package.json
    2. Update CHANGELOG.md with user-focused notes
    3. Commit with semantic message
    4. Push to main branch
    5. Monitor GitHub Actions
    6. Verify release publication
  
  failure_handling:
    - Fix any build errors immediately
    - Create stub files if needed
    - Resolve all CI/CD issues
    - NEVER mark task complete until release succeeds
```

#### Stage 11.2: GitHub Actions Monitoring

```yaml
CI_CD_Monitoring:
  workflows:
    - Auto Release on Main Push
    - Comprehensive CI
    - Emergency CI Stabilization
  
  success_criteria:
    - All workflows GREEN
    - Release tag created
    - Assets uploaded
    - GitHub release published
  
  failure_recovery:
    - Analyze failure logs
    - Fix issues immediately
    - Re-push fixes
    - Monitor until success
```

#### Stage 11.3: Release Verification

```yaml
Release_Verification:
  checks:
    - GitHub release exists
    - Version tag correct
    - CHANGELOG included
    - Build artifacts attached
    - Installation works
  
  completion_criteria:
    - Release publicly available
    - All CI/CD green
    - No rollback needed
    - User can install/update
```

### 🚨 ENTERPRISE COMPLETION CRITERIA
