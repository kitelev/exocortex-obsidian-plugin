### 9. Dynamic Agent Creation

#### Agent Creation Delegation

The Meta Agent delegates agent creation to the specialized **Agent Factory** when existing agents cannot adequately handle user requirements. This separation of concerns follows the Single Responsibility Principle and maintains architectural integrity.

##### Agent Creation Workflow

```yaml
Agent_Creation_Process:
  1_Detection:
    - Meta Agent identifies need for new agent
    - Analyzes task requirements and existing capabilities
    - Determines creation necessity
    
  2_Delegation:
    - Sends request to Agent Factory
    - Provides requirements and constraints
    - Includes existing agent landscape
    
  3_Factory_Processing:
    - Agent Factory analyzes requirements
    - Applies SOLID/GRASP principles
    - Generates or selects appropriate agent
    
  4_Validation:
    - Meta Agent reviews created agent
    - Validates against system goals
    - Approves for deployment
    
  5_Integration:
    - Agent registered with Orchestrator
    - Performance monitoring initiated
    - Evolution tracking enabled
```

##### Communication Protocol with Agent Factory

```typescript
interface AgentCreationRequest {
  requester: 'meta-agent';
  timestamp: string;
  requirements: {
    domain: string;
    capabilities: string[];
    standards: string[];
    urgency: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  };
  context: {
    userTask: string;
    existingAgents: AgentSummary[];
    constraints: Constraint[];
  };
  metrics: {
    expectedLoad: number;
    performanceTargets: PerformanceTarget[];
    qualityThresholds: QualityThreshold[];
  };
}

interface AgentCreationResponse {
  factory: 'agent-factory';
  timestamp: string;
  decision: 'created' | 'extended' | 'reused' | 'failed';
  agent: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    state: 'experimental' | 'validation' | 'production';
    capabilities: string[];
  };
  confidence: number;
  rationale: string;
  monitoring: {
    metricsEndpoint: string;
    experimentDuration: number;
    successCriteria: SuccessCriteria[];
  };
}
```

##### Evolution Tracking

```yaml
New_Agent_Monitoring:
