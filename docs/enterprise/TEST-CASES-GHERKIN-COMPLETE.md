# PART 1: CORE FUNCTIONALITY

## Feature: Semantic Knowledge Management

### Feature: SPARQL Query Execution

```gherkin
Feature: SPARQL Query Execution
  As a knowledge worker
  I want to execute SPARQL queries
  So that I can discover relationships in my knowledge graph

  Background:
    Given the RDF triple store is initialized
    And the following triples exist:
      | subject | predicate | object |
      | :Alice | :knows | :Bob |
      | :Bob | :knows | :Charlie |
      | :Alice | :worksAt | :Acme |

  Scenario: Execute SELECT query
    When I execute the SPARQL query:
      """
      SELECT ?person WHERE {
        ?person :knows :Bob
      }
      """
    Then the query should return results within 100ms
    And the results should contain:
      | person |
      | :Alice |

  Scenario: Execute CONSTRUCT query
    When I execute the SPARQL query:
      """
      CONSTRUCT { ?s :connected ?o }
      WHERE { ?s :knows ?o }
      """
    Then the query should return triples:
      | subject | predicate | object |
      | :Alice | :connected | :Bob |
      | :Bob | :connected | :Charlie |

  Scenario: Execute ASK query
    When I execute the SPARQL query:
      """
      ASK { :Alice :knows :Bob }
      """
    Then the query should return true

  Scenario: Query with property paths
    When I execute the SPARQL query:
      """
      SELECT ?person WHERE {
        :Alice :knows+ ?person
      }
      """
    Then the results should contain:
      | person |
      | :Bob |
      | :Charlie |

  Scenario: Query result caching
    Given I execute a complex SPARQL query
    When I execute the same query again
    Then the second query should use cached results
    And the cache hit rate should be above 90%
```

### Feature: RDF Triple Management

```gherkin
Feature: RDF Triple Management
  As a knowledge engineer
  I want to manage RDF triples
  So that I can build a semantic knowledge graph

  Scenario: Add triple to graph
    Given an empty RDF graph
    When I add the triple ":Subject :predicate :Object"
    Then the graph should contain 1 triple
    And the triple should be indexed in SPO, POS, and OSP indexes

  Scenario: Batch import triples
    Given an empty RDF graph
    When I import 1000 triples in batch mode
    Then all triples should be imported within 500ms
    And the graph should contain exactly 1000 triples

  Scenario: O(1) lookup performance
    Given a graph with 10000 triples
    When I lookup a specific triple pattern
    Then the lookup should complete in O(1) time
    And the result should be returned within 1ms

  Scenario: Delete triple from graph
    Given a graph containing the triple ":A :knows :B"
    When I delete the triple ":A :knows :B"
    Then the graph should not contain the triple
    And all indexes should be updated

  Scenario: Export triples to file
    Given a graph with 500 triples
    When I export the graph to RDF/XML format
    Then a valid RDF/XML file should be created
    And all triples should be preserved
```

### Feature: Ontology Management

```gherkin
Feature: Ontology Management
  As a knowledge architect
  I want to manage ontologies
  So that I can organize knowledge hierarchically

  Scenario: Create class hierarchy
    When I create an ontology with classes:
      | class | parent |
      | :Person | :Thing |
      | :Employee | :Person |
      | :Manager | :Employee |
    Then the ontology should have a valid hierarchy
    And :Manager should be a subclass of :Person

  Scenario: Define property inheritance
    Given a class :Person with property :name
    When I create a subclass :Employee
    Then :Employee should inherit the property :name

  Scenario: Validate OWL compatibility
    When I load an OWL ontology file
    Then the ontology should be parsed successfully
    And all OWL constructs should be recognized

  Scenario: Detect circular inheritance
    When I attempt to create circular inheritance:
      | class | parent |
      | :A | :B |
      | :B | :C |
      | :C | :A |
    Then the system should detect the cycle
    And reject the invalid hierarchy
```

# PART 2: SECURITY & VALIDATION

## Feature: Security Framework

### Feature: SPARQL Security Validation

```gherkin
Feature: SPARQL Security Validation
  As a security administrator
  I want to validate all SPARQL queries
  So that I can prevent injection attacks and system abuse

  Background:
    Given the security framework is enabled
    And rate limiting is configured to 100 requests per minute
    And query complexity limit is set to 1000

  Scenario: Prevent SPARQL injection
    When I submit a query with injection attempt:
      """
      SELECT * WHERE { 
        ?s ?p ?o . 
        } ; DROP GRAPH <http://example.com>
      """
    Then the query should be rejected
    And the security log should record the attempt
    And an alert should be sent to administrators

  Scenario: Block excessive query complexity
    When I submit a query with complexity score 1500
    Then the query should be rejected with error "Query too complex"
    And the complexity analysis should show:
      | metric | value |
      | triple_patterns | 50 |
      | optional_clauses | 20 |
      | filters | 30 |
      | estimated_cost | 1500 |

  Scenario: Enforce rate limiting
    Given I have made 99 requests in the last minute
    When I make 2 more requests
    Then the first request should succeed
    And the second request should be rate limited
    And receive a 429 status with retry-after header

  Scenario: Query timeout enforcement
    When I execute a query that runs for 6 seconds
    And the timeout is configured for 5 seconds
    Then the query should be terminated at 5 seconds
    And resources should be freed
    And an timeout error should be returned

  Scenario: Emergency mode activation
    When 10 security incidents occur within 1 minute
    Then emergency mode should activate automatically
    And all non-admin queries should be blocked
    And administrators should be notified immediately

  Scenario: Security incident logging
    When a security threat is detected
    Then the incident should be logged with:
      | field | content |
      | timestamp | ISO-8601 format |
      | threat_type | injection/dos/unauthorized |
      | source_ip | client IP address |
      | query | sanitized query text |
      | action_taken | blocked/rate_limited/logged |
    And the log should be tamper-proof

  Scenario: Whitelist trusted queries
    Given a query is added to the whitelist
    When the whitelisted query is executed
    Then it should bypass security checks
    But still be subject to resource limits
```

### Feature: Input Validation

```gherkin
Feature: Input Validation
  As a system administrator
  I want all inputs to be validated
  So that data integrity is maintained

  Scenario: Validate IRI format
    When I provide an IRI "not a valid IRI!"
    Then validation should fail with error "Invalid IRI format"
    And the IRI should not be processed

  Scenario: Validate file paths
    When I attempt to access "../../../etc/passwd"
    Then path validation should fail
    And access should be denied
    And the path should be logged as suspicious

  Scenario: Validate property values
    Given a property "age" with type "integer"
    When I set the value to "twenty"
    Then validation should fail
    And error should indicate "Expected integer, got string"

  Scenario: Sanitize user input
    When user enters HTML "<script>alert('xss')</script>"
    Then the input should be sanitized to "&lt;script&gt;alert('xss')&lt;/script&gt;"
    And no script execution should occur

  Scenario: Validate UUID format
    When I provide UUID "not-a-uuid"
    Then validation should fail
    And error should indicate "Invalid UUID v4 format"
```

# PART 6: CACHING & PERFORMANCE

## Feature: Cache Management

### Feature: Query Result Caching

```gherkin
Feature: Query Result Caching
  As a system
  I want to cache query results
  So that performance is optimized

  Background:
    Given the cache is enabled
    And cache size is set to 1000 entries
    And TTL is set to 30 minutes

  Scenario: Cache hit for identical query
    Given I execute query "SELECT * WHERE { ?s :type :Project }"
    When I execute the same query within 30 seconds
    Then the result should be served from cache
    And response time should be <10ms
    And cache hit counter should increment

  Scenario: Cache miss for new query
    When I execute a query not in cache
    Then the query should execute normally
    And the result should be added to cache
    And cache miss counter should increment

  Scenario: Cache invalidation on data change
    Given query results are cached for "SELECT * WHERE { ?s :type :Task }"
    When I create a new task
    Then the cached query should be invalidated
    And next execution should fetch fresh data

  Scenario: LRU eviction policy
    Given the cache is at maximum capacity
    When I add a new cache entry
    Then the least recently used entry should be evicted
    And cache size should remain at maximum

  Scenario: Cache memory pressure handling
    When system memory usage exceeds 80%
    Then cache should reduce size by 50%
    And evict entries based on:
      | priority | criteria |
      | 1 | Expired entries |
      | 2 | Large result sets |
      | 3 | Least recently used |

    When I create an asset without title
    Then validation should fail
    And error should list missing required fields

  Scenario: Validate property types
    Given a property "count" with type "integer"
    When I set value to "not a number"
    Then validation should fail
    And error should indicate type mismatch

  Scenario: Validate business rules
    Given a rule "end_date must be after start_date"
    When I set end_date before start_date
    Then validation should fail
    And error should explain the rule violation

  Scenario: Validation report generation
    When I run validation on all assets
    Then a report should be generated with:
      | section | content |

    Then the triple should be rejected
    And error should indicate "Invalid IRI format"

  Scenario: Validate graph consistency
    When I import an RDF file
    Then the validator should check:
      | check | description |
      | IRIs | All IRIs are valid |
      | Literals | Literals have correct datatypes |
      | Predicates | Predicates are defined |
      | Blank nodes | No orphaned blank nodes |

  Scenario: Validate ontology constraints
    Given an ontology with cardinality constraints
    When I add data violating constraints

# PART 8: ERROR HANDLING & RESILIENCE

## Feature: Circuit Breaker

### Feature: Circuit Breaker Service

```gherkin
Feature: Circuit Breaker Service
  As a system
  I want circuit breakers for external calls
  So that cascading failures are prevented

  Background:
    Given circuit breaker is configured with:
      | setting | value |
      | failure_threshold | 5 |
      | timeout | 30 seconds |
      | reset_timeout | 60 seconds |

  Scenario: Circuit opens on threshold
    Given the circuit is closed
    When 5 consecutive failures occur
    Then the circuit should open
    And subsequent calls should fail fast
    And administrators should be alerted

  Scenario: Circuit half-open state
    Given the circuit has been open for 60 seconds
    When a request is made
    Then the circuit should enter half-open state
    And allow one test request through
    If successful, circuit should close
    If failed, circuit should reopen

  Scenario: Circuit breaker metrics
    When I query circuit breaker status
    Then I should see:
      | metric | description |
      | state | closed/open/half-open |
      | failure_count | Number of failures |
      | success_count | Number of successes |

## Feature: Repository Operations

### Feature: Asset Repository

```gherkin
Feature: Asset Repository Operations
  As a system
  I want reliable asset persistence
  So that data is never lost

  Scenario: Save asset with conflict resolution
    Given an asset exists with ID "123"
    When two users modify it simultaneously
    Then conflict should be detected
    And resolution strategy should be applied:
      | strategy | action |
      | last_write_wins | Later change overwrites |
      | merge | Compatible changes merged |
      | manual | User prompted to resolve |

  Scenario: Batch save operations
    When I save 100 assets in batch
    Then all saves should be atomic
    If any save fails, all should rollback
    And error should indicate which asset failed

  Scenario: Repository failover
    Given primary storage is unavailable
    When I attempt to save an asset
    Then system should failover to backup storage
    And operation should succeed
    And sync should occur when primary returns

# PART 10: INTEGRATION FEATURES

## Feature: Offline Operations

### Feature: Offline Data Manager

```gherkin
Feature: Offline Data Manager
  As a mobile user
  I want to work offline
  So that I'm productive without internet

  Scenario: Queue operations while offline
    Given I am offline
    When I create 5 assets and modify 3 others
    Then operations should be queued locally
    And I should see pending sync indicator

  Scenario: Sync when online
    Given I have 8 queued operations
    When connection is restored
    Then sync should start automatically
    And progress should be shown
    And conflicts should be resolved

  Scenario: Offline data availability
    Given I frequently access certain assets
    When I go offline
    Then frequently used data should be available
    And I can continue working with cached data
```
