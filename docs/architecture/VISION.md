# Exocortex Semantic Architecture Vision

## Executive Summary

The Exocortex represents a revolutionary **semantic knowledge management platform** that augments human cognitive capabilities through AI-assisted reasoning and knowledge organization. This document outlines the architectural vision for transforming the current implementation into a truly semantic, privacy-first, and extensible cognitive prosthesis.

## Core Philosophy

> "Transforming daily routine into daily adventure through semantic augmentation of human cognition"

The Exocortex is not merely a productivity tool but a **cognitive companion** that:

- Extends human memory through semantic knowledge graphs
- Enables complex reasoning through SPARQL queries
- Preserves absolute privacy through cryptographic architecture
- Evolves with the user through ontology-driven extensibility

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Semantic-First Design

- **RDF/OWL** as the foundational data model
- **SPARQL 1.1** for querying and reasoning
- **SHACL** for data validation
- **Ontology-driven** UI and behavior

### 2. Privacy by Architecture

- **UUID-only public exposure** - all data remains private
- **Cryptographic access control** at the property level
- **Zero-knowledge** protocol design
- **Local-first** with optional selective sync

### 3. Clean Architecture & DDD

- **Hexagonal architecture** with clear boundaries
- **Domain-driven design** with rich domain models
- **CQRS** for read/write separation
- **Event sourcing** for temporal reasoning

### 4. Extensibility Through Ontologies

- **Plugin-as-ontology** architecture
- **Semantic interoperability** between plugins
- **Inheritance hierarchies** for knowledge reuse
- **Versioned evolution** with migration paths

```

## Core Components

### 1. Knowledge Object System

```typescript
interface KnowledgeObject {
  uuid: UUID; // Globally unique identifier
  type: IRI; // Ontology class reference
  properties: Map<IRI, Value>; // Semantic properties
  relations: Map<IRI, UUID[]>; // Semantic relationships
  content?: MarkdownContent; // Optional content body
}
```

### 2. Ontology Management

```typescript
interface Ontology {
  namespace: IRI;
  prefix: string;
  classes: Map<IRI, ClassDefinition>;
  properties: Map<IRI, PropertyDefinition>;
  rules: SHACL.Shape[];
  version: SemanticVersion;
}
```

### 3. Privacy Layer

```typescript
interface PrivacyAdapter {
  encrypt(data: any, level: PrivacyLevel): EncryptedData;
  decrypt(data: EncryptedData, key: CryptoKey): any;
  share(uuid: UUID, properties: IRI[], recipient: PublicKey): ShareToken;
  revoke(token: ShareToken): void;
}
```

### 4. Reasoning Engine

```typescript
interface ReasoningEngine {
  query(sparql: string): ResultSet;
  infer(rules: OWL.Axiom[]): Triple[];
  validate(data: Graph, shapes: SHACL.Shape[]): ValidationReport;
  explain(conclusion: Triple): ProofTree;
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Semantic Foundation (Current)
