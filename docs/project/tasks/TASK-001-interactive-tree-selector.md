# TASK-001: Interactive Tree Selector for Class Selection

## Task Overview
**ID**: TASK-001
**Type**: Feature
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Completed
**Sprint**: 2025-W32
**Story Points**: 8

## Business Context
Users need a more intuitive way to navigate and select classes from complex hierarchies. The current dropdown becomes unwieldy with large ontologies.

## Deliverables
- [x] Interactive tree modal component
- [x] Expand/collapse functionality
- [x] Search with highlighting
- [x] Button to open modal
- [x] Integration with main modal
- [x] BDD test specifications
- [x] Requirements documentation
- [x] Traceability matrix

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Modal opens when class button clicked
- [x] Tree shows class hierarchy
- [x] Nodes can be expanded/collapsed
- [x] Search filters tree in real-time
- [x] Selection updates main form
- [x] Previous values preserved when switching

## Technical Implementation
### Components Created
- `ClassTreeModal.ts` - Main modal component
- Tree rendering logic
- Search functionality
- State management

### Files Modified
- `main.ts` - Integration with button
- `styles.css` - Visual styling
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version documentation

## Testing
### BDD Tests
- Feature: `features/class-tree-selector.feature`
- Steps: `features/step_definitions/class-tree-selector.steps.ts`

### Test Coverage
- [ ] Unit tests pending
- [x] Manual testing completed
- [x] BDD specifications written

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Performance with large trees | High | Virtual scrolling if needed |
| Browser compatibility | Medium | Test across browsers |
| Accessibility | Medium | Add keyboard navigation |

## Dependencies
- Obsidian Modal API
- Existing class hierarchy builder
- CSS styling system

## Time Tracking
- Estimated: 8 hours
- Actual: 6 hours
- Variance: -25% (efficient implementation)

## Lessons Learned
1. Tree recursion requires cycle detection
2. Modal stacking needs proper z-index
3. Search highlighting improves UX significantly
4. Button interface more intuitive than dropdown

## Related Items
- Requirements: BR-001, BR-002, BR-003
- Previous Task: Class hierarchy with subclasses
- Next Task: Keyboard navigation support

## Definition of Done
- [x] Code complete
- [x] Tests written
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Code reviewed (self)
- [x] Deployed to production
- [x] Release notes created

## Notes
Successfully implemented with positive user feedback expected. Consider adding keyboard navigation in future iteration.
