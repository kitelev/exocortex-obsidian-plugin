## Creating Projects

### Using Create Project Button

1. Open area note in Reading Mode
2. Click **"Create Project"**
3. Fill form:
   - **Label**: Project name
   - **Status**: `ems__EffortStatusBacklog` (default)
   - **Area**: Auto-filled

Result: `projects/project-build-api.md` created with:

```yaml
---
exo__Instance_class: ems__Project
exo__Asset_label: Build API Server
ems__Effort_area: "[[Development]]"
ems__Effort_status: "[[ems__EffortStatusBacklog]]"
---

# Build API Server

REST API for mobile app.
```

### Manual Creation

```yaml
---
exo__Instance_class: ems__Project
exo__Asset_label: [Project Name]
ems__Effort_area: "[[Area Name]]"
ems__Effort_status: "[[ems__EffortStatusBacklog]]"
ems__Effort_votes: 0
---

# [Project Name]

## Objective
[What success looks like]

## Key Deliverables
- [ ] Deliverable 1
- [ ] Deliverable 2

## Timeline
Target: [Date or Quarter]
```

---

## Project Lifecycle

### States

```
Draft → Backlog → Analysis → ToDo → Doing → Done
```

Same as tasks, but:
- **Backlog**: Awaiting resource allocation
- **Analysis**: Defining scope, tasks, timeline
- **ToDo**: Ready to start (tasks created)
- **Doing**: Active work on tasks
- **Done**: All tasks completed

### Typical Duration

| Status | Duration | Percentage Complete |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| Draft | 1-7 days | 0% |
| Backlog | Weeks to months | 0% |
| Analysis | 1-5 days | 0-10% |
| ToDo | Days to weeks | 10-20% |
| Doing | Weeks to months | 20-95% |
| Done | Permanent | 100% |

## Task Management

### Creating Project Tasks

1. Open project note
2. Click **"Create Task"** repeatedly for each work item
3. Tasks auto-link to project via `ems__Effort_project`

### Breaking Down Projects

**Good project = 5-15 tasks**

Too few tasks (<3):
- May not need project structure
- Consider converting to single task

Too many tasks (>20):
- Break into milestones
- Create multiple projects
- Group related tasks

### Example: API Server Project

```
Build API Server (Project)
├── Set up Node.js environment (Task)
├── Configure Express server (Task)
├── Build /users endpoint (Task)
├── Build /posts endpoint (Task)
├── Implement authentication (Task)
├── Write API tests (Task)
├── Deploy to staging (Task)
└── Deploy to production (Task)
```

---

## Tracking Progress

### Progress Calculation

Exocortex doesn't auto-calculate progress. Track manually:

**Option 1: Checklist in content**
```markdown
## Progress

- [x] Environment setup
- [x] Express configuration
- [ ] User endpoint
- [ ] Post endpoint
- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Deployment
```

**Option 2: Add progress property**
```yaml
ems__Effort_progress_percentage: 40
```

**Option 3: Count completed tasks**
- 3 / 8 tasks done = 37.5% complete

### Project Dashboard

View project status from project note:

**Asset Relations section shows:**
- All child tasks
- Status of each task
- Vote counts
- Scheduled dates

**Sort by status** to see:
- What's done
- What's in progress
- What's blocked

### Daily Project View

Schedule entire project to daily note:

```yaml
ems__Effort_scheduled_start_date: "2025-11-10"
```

**Daily Projects section shows:**
- Project and all its tasks
- Task statuses
- Quick access to start tasks

---

## Project Completion

### Completion Criteria

Project is done when:
- [ ] All tasks completed or archived
- [ ] Deliverables met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Stakeholders notified

### Marking Project Done

1. Verify all tasks complete
2. Click **"Mark Done"** on project note
3. Add completion summary in content:

```markdown
## Completion Summary

**Completed**: 2025-11-15
**Duration**: 3 weeks
**Tasks**: 8 completed, 2 archived (out of scope)

### Outcomes
- API deployed to production
- 95% test coverage
- Documentation published

### Lessons Learned
- Authentication took longer than expected
- Should have split user/post endpoints into separate stories
```

### Post-Completion

- Project remains in relations
- Tasks remain accessible
- Archive project if needed (optional)

---

## Best Practices

### Project Naming

**Good:**
- "Build Mobile App"
- "Migrate to Kubernetes"
- "Launch Marketing Campaign Q4"

**Bad:**
- "Project 1" (not descriptive)
- "Do stuff" (vague)
- "Fix things" (use task instead)

### Project Scope

**Clear scope indicators:**
- Specific objective
- Defined deliverables
- Measurable success criteria
- Time-bounded (even if flexible)

**Scope creep warning signs:**
- Tasks keep getting added
- No clear completion criteria
- "One more feature" syndrome

**Fix**: Create new project for scope additions

### Vote on Projects

Prioritize projects within area:

1. Open area note
2. View all projects in Asset Relations
3. Vote on high-value projects
4. Move top-voted to Analysis

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Milestone Projects

For large initiatives:

```
Phase 1: MVP
├── Core features (Project)
├── Basic UI (Project)
└── Alpha testing (Project)

Phase 2: Enhancement
├── Advanced features (Project)
├── Polish UI (Project)
└── Beta testing (Project)
```

### Pattern 2: Epic Projects

Group related projects under area:

```
Mobile App Development (Area)
├── iOS App (Project)
├── Android App (Project)
├── Backend API (Project)
└── Shared Components (Project)
```

### Pattern 3: Recurring Projects

Quarterly/annual projects:

```
Q4 2025 Marketing (Project)
├── Content calendar (Task)
├── Social media campaigns (Task)
├── Email newsletters (Task)
└── Analytics review (Task)
```

Clone for next quarter, update dates.
