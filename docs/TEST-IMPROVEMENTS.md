# Test Architecture Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Increased Test Coverage Threshold to 70%
- Updated `jest.config.js` to require 70% coverage for all metrics (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- Previous: 34% threshold
- New: 70% threshold
- Industry standard for production-ready code

### 2. ✅ Added Contract Testing
- Created `tests/contract/obsidian-api.contract.test.ts`
- Validates our mock implementations match Obsidian API contracts
- Ensures compatibility when Obsidian updates
- Tests cover: Vault, TFile, App, Modal, Plugin, MetadataCache, Workspace, Platform, DOM Extensions

### 3. ✅ Simple Mutation Testing
- Created mutation testing infrastructure in `tests/mutation/`
- Script-based approach: `scripts/run-mutation-tests.sh`
- Tests quality of unit tests by introducing mutations
- Ensures tests actually catch bugs
- 60% mutation score threshold

## How to Use

```bash
# Run contract tests
npm run test:contract

# Run mutation tests  
npm run test:mutation

# Run all tests as before
npm test
```

## Benefits

1. **Higher Confidence**: 70% coverage ensures most code paths are tested
2. **API Compatibility**: Contract tests prevent breaking changes with Obsidian updates
3. **Test Quality**: Mutation testing verifies tests actually catch bugs
4. **Simple Implementation**: No complex tools, easy to maintain

## Architecture Remains Clean

- No overengineering
- Simple, maintainable solutions
- Follows existing patterns
- Production-ready without complexity
