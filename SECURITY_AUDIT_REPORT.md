### 5. Security NPM Scripts
- **Added Scripts:**
  - `npm run security:audit` - Run security audit
  - `npm run security:audit:fix` - Auto-fix vulnerabilities
  - `npm run security:check` - Full security + quality check

### 6. Dependency Updates
- **obsidian:** 1.10.0 → 1.10.2
- **ts-jest:** 29.4.4 → 29.4.5
- All updates verified safe with zero vulnerabilities

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risk Level: LOW

| Risk Category | Level | Notes |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| Dependency Vulnerabilities | LOW | 0 vulnerabilities, automated scanning active |
| Code Security | LOW | No dangerous patterns, strict type safety |
| Data Exposure | LOW | Local-only storage, no external transmission |
| Supply Chain | LOW | Dependabot + CodeQL monitoring |
| Configuration | LOW | Secure defaults, secrets excluded |
| Authentication | LOW | Uses Obsidian's built-in security |

## Compliance

### Security Best Practices
- ✅ OWASP Top 10 considerations applied
- ✅ Secure development lifecycle
- ✅ Automated vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Dependency management
- ✅ Security policy documented
- ✅ Incident response plan

### Code Quality
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ✅ ESLint security rules
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ CI/CD security checks

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Continuous Security
1. **Daily:** npm audit via GitHub Actions
2. **Weekly:** CodeQL scans and Dependabot updates
3. **On PR:** Dependency review and security checks
4. **Pre-commit:** Automated tests and checks via Husky

### Alert Channels
