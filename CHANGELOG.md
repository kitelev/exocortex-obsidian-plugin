## [12.5.13] - 2025-10-12

### Added

- **Task Creation from Projects**: Create tasks directly from Project assets
  - "Create Task" button now appears in layouts for both `ems__Area` AND `ems__Project` assets
  - Tasks created from Areas use `ems__Effort_area` property (existing behavior)
  - Tasks created from Projects use `ems__Effort_parent` property (new)
  - Unified task creation workflow across different asset types

### Enhanced

- **Task Creation UX**: Automatic focus switching to newly created task
  - When you click "Create Task" button, the new task file opens in a new tab
  - Focus automatically switches to the new tab so you can start working immediately
  - Improves workflow efficiency - no need to manually switch tabs
  - Seamless transition from Area/Project to Task creation

### Technical

- Implemented Strategy Pattern for property mapping (SOLID + DRY principles)
- Single `createTask()` method handles both Areas and Projects
- Backward compatible with existing Area functionality
- 100% test coverage maintained (29 component + 11 UI + 20 unit tests)

### User Benefits

- **Flexible Task Management**: Create tasks from either Areas or Projects based on your workflow
- **Consistent Experience**: Same button, same process, different context
- **Proper Relationships**: Tasks automatically link to their parent Area or Project with correct property

**Usage Example:**
- Open a Project note → Click "Create Task" → New task with `ems__Effort_parent: "[[Your Project]]"`
- Open an Area note → Click "Create Task" → New task with `ems__Effort_area: "[[Your Area]]"`

## [12.5.11] - 2025-10-05

### Changed

- **Task Creation**: Changed property name from `exo__Effort_area` to `ems__Effort_area`
  - Aligns with EMS ontology namespace convention

  - Updated all tests and BDD scenarios

### Breaking Change

- Tasks created with this version will use `ems__Effort_area` instead of `exo__Effort_area`
- Existing tasks with `exo__Effort_area` are not affected
- This is the correct property name per EMS ontology specification

## [12.5.10] - 2025-10-05

### Fixed

- **Task Creation**: Fixed missing quotes around `exo__Asset_isDefinedBy` wiki-link
  - Now automatically adds quotes if they're missing in source Area
  - Handles both quoted (`"[[!toos]]"`) and unquoted (`[[!toos]]`) formats from source
  - Ensures consistent quoted format in created Tasks
  - Added `ensureQuoted()` helper function for robust wiki-link quoting

### Tests

- Added 2 new unit tests for unquoted wiki-link handling
- Total tests: 19 (15 unit + 4 other)
- All tests passing ✅

## [12.5.9] - 2025-10-05

### Fixed

- **Task Creation**: Fixed frontmatter formatting to use correct YAML format with quoted wiki-links

  - `exo__Asset_isDefinedBy` now properly quoted: `"[[!toos]]"` instead of `[[!toos]]`
  - `exo__Effort_area` now properly quoted: `"[[Area Name]]"` instead of `[[Area Name]]`
  - Handles both string and array formats in source Area metadata
  - Ensures Obsidian can properly parse and display wiki-links

### Added

## [12.5.5] - 2025-10-04

### Documentation

- **Development Standards**: Added CRITICAL rule prohibiting bypass of pre-commit hooks
  - NEVER use `--no-verify` flag to skip pre-commit hooks
  - Pre-commit hooks protect code quality and prevent broken commits
  - If hooks fail, fix the underlying issue rather than bypassing the check
  - Bypassing hooks is a serious violation of development standards

### Fixed

- **Pre-commit Hook**: Force ARM64 architecture for node to ensure correct rollup binary loads
