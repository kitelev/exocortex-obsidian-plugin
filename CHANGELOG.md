## [3.12.1] - 2025-08-21

### üîß Critical Fix: Dynamic Backlinks Now Actually Work!

#### Fixed Issues
- **UUID-Based References**: Dynamic backlinks now properly handle UUID-based references like `[[82c74542-1b14-4217-b852-d84730484b25]]`
- **Path-Based Link Resolution**: Links like `[[Area - My]]` now correctly resolve to target files through Obsidian's link resolution system  
- **Mixed Reference Formats**: Support for all reference formats in the same vault (filenames, UUIDs, display names)
- **Real Exocortex Structure**: Verified to work with actual user vault structure (Areas, Efforts, Projects)

#### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced `DynamicBacklinksService.isReferencingTarget()` method with comprehensive reference matching
- Added link resolution via `metadataCache.getFirstLinkpathDest()` for proper path-based matching
- Comprehensive test coverage with real-world scenarios from user's vault
- Integration tests verify behavior with actual exocortex file structures

#### What Users Will See
- **Effort Area** sections now appear with all Projects and Tasks that reference the Area
- **Project Area** sections show related Projects
- Property-based grouping works correctly with `ems__Effort_area`, `ems__Project_area`, etc.
- No more empty "No property-based backlinks found" messages

This fixes the critical issue where users saw no dynamic property blocks even though relationships existed in their vault.

### üîó Hierarchical Effort Organization - Children Efforts Block

#### Transform Your Effort Management Experience
Organize your hierarchical effort structures with **crystal clarity**! The new Children Efforts block revolutionizes how you visualize and navigate parent-child relationships in your knowledge base.

#### New Children Efforts Block
- **Smart Separation**: Children Efforts now display separately from general backlinks for cleaner organization
- **Hierarchical Clarity**: See parent-child effort relationships at a glance with dedicated visualization
- **Parent Path Display**: Instantly understand the hierarchical context of each child effort
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Only shows assets that reference the current asset via `ems__Effort_parent` property
- **Consistent UI**: Follows the same familiar design patterns as other Exocortex blocks

#### Enhanced Referenced By Block
- **Cleaner Results**: Referenced By block now excludes parent-child relationships (shown in Children Efforts instead)
- **Focused Content**: See only genuine references and relationships, not structural hierarchy
- **Better Organization**: Clear separation between hierarchical structure and cross-references
- **Improved Clarity**: Reduced cognitive load with more focused, relevant information

#### Perfect for Complex Project Hierarchies

##### Project Managers
- **Visual Project Structure**: See complete effort hierarchies with parent-child relationships clearly displayed
- **Instant Navigation**: Click through from parent efforts to child tasks and sub-projects
- **Organizational Clarity**: Understand project breakdown structure at any level
- **Context Awareness**: Never lose sight of where you are in the project hierarchy

##### Knowledge Workers

- **Consistent Styling**: Matches existing Exocortex design language perfectly
- **Performance Optimized**: Fast rendering even with deep hierarchical structures

#### What This Looks Like in Practice

Before v3.3.0:
- Parent-child relationships mixed with other backlinks
- Difficult to distinguish structural hierarchy from references
- Cognitive overhead trying to parse relationship types

After v3.3.0:
- **Children Efforts block**: Shows only direct child efforts with parent path context
- **Referenced By block**: Shows only genuine references and cross-links
- **Clear Visual Separation**: Immediate understanding of information architecture
- **Hierarchical Navigation**: Smooth traversal up and down effort hierarchies

#### Technical Excellence
- **17 New Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for both Children Efforts and enhanced Referenced By blocks
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Maintains 100% backward compatibility with existing configurations
- **Robust Implementation**: Proper error handling and graceful degradation
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient filtering algorithms for fast rendering

#### Getting Started
The Children Efforts block appears automatically in any asset that has child efforts (other assets that reference it via `ems__Effort_parent`). No configuration needed - it just works!

Example: Open any parent effort in your project hierarchy and you'll now see:
1. **Children Efforts block**: Lists all child efforts with clear hierarchical context
2. **Referenced By block**: Shows other references excluding the parent-child relationships
3. **Crystal Clear Organization**: Immediately understand your project structure

### üéØ Why This Release Matters

This release addresses a core user experience challenge in hierarchical knowledge management:

## [3.2.1] - 2025-08-20

### üîß Critical DataviewJS Integration Fix

#### Fixed ExoUIRender Function Export
Resolved a critical bug where the `window.ExoUIRender` function was not properly accessible in DataviewJS blocks, causing "ExoUIRender is not a function" errors when trying to render class layouts.

#### What This Fixes
- **DataviewJS Integration**: The `ExoUIRender` function is now correctly exported to the global window object during plugin initialization
- **Layout Rendering**: DataviewJS blocks can now properly call `await window.ExoUIRender(dv, this)` to render class-based layouts
- **Error Prevention**: Eliminates the "ExoUIRender is not a function" error that was preventing layout rendering
- **Clean Unload**: Function is properly removed from global scope when plugin is unloaded

#### How DataviewJS Integration Works
```javascript
// In your DataviewJS blocks, you can now reliably use:
await window.ExoUIRender(dv, this);
```

This function:
- Detects the current active file context
- Loads the appropriate class layout based on the file's `exo__Instance_class` property  
- Renders properties, queries, backlinks, and custom blocks defined in your layout
- Provides graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

#### Technical Details
- Added proper export of `ExoUIRender` function to `window` object during plugin initialization
- Function is available immediately after plugin loads for all DataviewJS blocks
- Added cleanup on plugin unload to remove the global function
- Enhanced error handling for missing files and malformed layouts
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability across different scenarios

#### User Impact
Users who were experiencing "ExoUIRender is not a function" errors in their DataviewJS blocks will now find that their layouts render properly without any code changes needed.

**Perfect for knowledge management workflows that combine Dataview queries with Exocortex class-based layouts!** üéØüìä
