## [2.3.0] - 2025-08-09

### üöÄ Added - Relation Ontologization Feature
- **Relation Ontologization Command** - Convert asset properties into first-class Relation objects

- **Bidirectional Relations** - Automatically create inverse relations for complete graph
- **N-ary Relations** - Support for complex relationships between multiple assets
- **Vault Migration** - Convert entire vault to relation-based model with progress tracking
- **RelationAsset Entity** - New domain entity for managing relations as assets

### Features
- New "Ontologize Asset Relations" command in Command Palette
- Automatic extraction of object properties from frontmatter
- Wiki link pattern detection for relationship discovery

### Technical
- RelationOntologizer service for property-to-relation conversion
- RelationAssetHelper for bidirectional relation creation
- Support for inverse predicate mapping
- YAML generation for relation frontmatter
- Comprehensive test coverage for all relation operations

### Why This Matters
Relation Ontologization transforms Obsidian into a true graph database where:
- Every relationship is a trackable, versioned entity
- Event Sourcing enables complete history of knowledge evolution
- Bidirectional relations provide full graph traversal
- N-ary relations support complex real-world relationships
- Relations can have their own metadata, confidence scores, and provenance

Example:
```yaml
# Before (in Task asset)
ems__Task_project: "[[Project Alpha]]"
ems__Task_assignedTo: "[[John Doe]]"

# After (as Relation assets)
Relation 1:
  subject: Task-123
  predicate: ems__Task_project
  object: Project Alpha
  confidence: 1.0
  inverseOf: Relation-2

Relation 2:
  subject: Project Alpha
  predicate: ems__Project_hasTasks
  object: Task-123
  confidence: 1.0
  inverseOf: Relation-1
```

## [2.2.0] - 2025-08-09

### üöÄ Added - Critical MVP Feature
- **CONSTRUCT Query Support** - Enables reasoning and knowledge inference
- **Template-based Triple Generation** - Generate new knowledge from patterns

### Why This Matters
CONSTRUCT queries are what distinguish Exocortex from simple query tools. They enable:
- Automated reasoning and inference

- Rule-based knowledge generation
- Semantic relationship discovery

Example:
```sparql
CONSTRUCT {
  ?person ems:contributesTo ?project
}
WHERE {
  ?task ems:assignedTo ?person .
  ?task ems:partOf ?project .
}
```
