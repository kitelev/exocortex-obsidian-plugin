## Agent Selection Algorithm (ENHANCED)

```
IF critical_system_failure OR emergency_situation:
    USE Emergency Sprint Pattern (Pattern 4)
    DEPLOY 7+ agents in maximum parallel formation
    TIMELINE: 0-15 minutes target resolution
    
ELIF task involves multiple files OR complexity > simple:
    IF feature_development:
        USE Feature Development Pipeline
    ELIF bug_fix:
        USE Debug and Fix Pattern
    ELIF architecture_change:
        USE Architecture Analysis Pattern
    ELIF quality_review:
        USE Quality Assessment Pattern
    ELIF memory_issues OR performance_degradation:
        USE Performance Optimization Pattern
    ELSE:
        SELECT 3-5 most relevant agents
        EXECUTE in parallel where possible
        
ELSE:
    MAY work without agents (simple, single-file tasks)
    
# Emergency Detection Criteria:
critical_system_failure = (
    CI_failure_rate > 90% OR
    memory_cascade_errors OR
    system_completely_unstable OR
    production_blocking_issues
)
```
