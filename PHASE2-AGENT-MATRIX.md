## 3. TASK DEPENDENCY MATRIX

### 3.1 Critical Path Dependencies

| Predecessor Task | Successor Task | Agent | Dependency Type | Buffer Time |
|-----------------|----------------|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| Fix failing tests | Domain coverage | Test Infra → Domain | Finish-to-Start | 0.5 days |
| Coverage reporting | Quality gates | Test Infra → QA | Finish-to-Start | 0 days |
| Domain analysis | Integration tests | Domain → Integration | Start-to-Start | 1 day |
| Framework setup | Benchmarks | Performance → Performance | Finish-to-Start | 0 days |
| Workflow tests | E2E scenarios | Integration → Integration | Finish-to-Start | 0.5 days |

### 3.2 Resource Conflict Resolution

#### Potential Conflicts
1. **CI/CD Pipeline Congestion** (Days 10-11)
   - **Risk**: Multiple agents pushing tests simultaneously
   - **Mitigation**: Staggered commit windows (2-hour slots per agent)
   - **Fallback**: Priority-based queue (Infrastructure > Domain > Integration > Performance)

2. **Test Infrastructure Access** (Days 8-9)
   - **Risk**: Multiple agents modifying test config
   - **Mitigation**: Test Infrastructure Agent owns all config changes
   - **Coordination**: Other agents submit config requests via tickets

3. **Coverage Analysis Conflicts** (Throughout)
   - **Risk**: Inconsistent coverage measurements
   - **Mitigation**: Centralized coverage reporting by QA Agent
   - **Process**: Daily coverage snapshots at 5 PM
