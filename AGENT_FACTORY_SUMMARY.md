const factory = new AgentFactory({
  monitoringEnabled: true,
  evolutionEnabled: true,
  qualityThreshold: 0.8
});

// Request agent creation
const request = {
  requirements: {
    domain: 'mobile-testing',
    complexity: 7,
    urgency: 'high',
    capabilities: ['ios-testing', 'android-testing', 'performance-testing'],
    constraints: ['device-compatibility'],
    expectedLoad: 150
  },
  urgency: 'high',
  requesterId: 'mobile-team',
  context: { platform: 'mobile', deadline: '2025-08-25' }

// Factory analyzes and creates appropriate agent
const result = await factory.createAgent(request);

// Result: CREATE_NEW_AGENT decision with specialized mobile testing agent
