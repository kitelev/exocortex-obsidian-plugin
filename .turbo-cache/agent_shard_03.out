Based on the code analysis, here are the key findings:

## Critical Bug Analysis Summary

• **Memory Leaks**: Unbounded cache growth in `ObsidianTaskRepository` and insufficient cleanup in modal components, confirmed by memory optimization test setup

• **Silent Error Handling**: `ObsidianAssetRepository.findById()` silently ignores invalid assets (lines 29-32), potentially masking data corruption without user awareness

• **Security Vulnerabilities**: File path injection risks in `FileOperationUtils.findFileWithFallback()` and incomplete directory traversal protection in filename sanitization

• **Race Conditions**: `SPARQLEngine` lacks thread safety for cache operations, and concurrent file modifications aren't properly handled in the main plugin lifecycle

• **Architecture Violations**: Clean Architecture boundaries blurred with infrastructure repositories directly accessing Obsidian APIs without proper abstraction layers

• **Performance Issues**: O(n) file scanning in repository `find*` methods instead of using indexes, plus inefficient regex operations in `SPARQLEngine.parsePatterns()`

• **Test Coverage Gaps**: Critical components like `QueryContext` and `SaveTemplateModal` lack error scenario testing, reducing bug detection effectiveness

• **Data Consistency**: Graph updates during file operations lack transactional safety, creating potential inconsistent state windows

The most critical issues are the memory leaks, silent error handling, and race conditions that could affect plugin stability and data integrity.
