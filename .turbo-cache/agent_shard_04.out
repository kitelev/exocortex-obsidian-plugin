## Potential Bugs Found - Structural Analysis Summary

• **Memory Leaks**: SecurityMonitor creates uncleaned intervals, AgentTemplateSystem retains object references, ExoFocusService has unmanaged async operations

• **Race Conditions**: Multiple async operations in ExoFocusService without proper sequencing, AgentOrchestrator shared state access issues, cache operations in SPARQLAutocompleteService

• **Null/Undefined Access**: Missing null checks in QueryTemplateUseCase template operations, ErrorHandlerService direct property access, widespread use of non-null assertions without validation

• **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Mixed Result pattern vs exception throwing across codebase, silent failures in cache operations, generic catch blocks masking specific errors

• **Security Vulnerabilities**: Basic SPARQL sanitization may allow injection attacks, ReDoS vulnerability in regex tokenization, potential information leakage in error messages

• **Performance Issues**: Linear search operations in SecurityMonitor cleanup, inefficient cache management in autocomplete service, complex nested loops in agent scoring

• **Resource Management**: Unmanaged intervals and timers, potential circular dependencies in agent system, inconsistent cleanup patterns

• **Test Infrastructure Problems**: Global prototype extensions in mocks, over-mocking hiding integration issues, complex mock setups not representing production behavior
