Feature: Effort Lifecycle Workflow
  As a user managing tasks and projects
  I want a structured workflow with clear state transitions
  So that I can manage task maturity and track completion status

  Background:
    Given I am viewing a note with UniversalLayout
    And the plugin is properly initialized

      And resolutionTimestamp is set
      And startTimestamp is preserved
      And no endTimestamp is added

    Scenario: Trash button visible for Draft, Backlog, and Doing

      Then Task is trashed
      And resolutionTimestamp is set
      And endTimestamp is not set

  Rule: Archive completed or trashed efforts

    Scenario: Archive Done task
      Given I have a Task with:
        | Property                         | Value                           |

        | archived                         | false                           |
      When I click "To Archive" button

        | Trashed Task    | Trashed  | false    |
        | Doing Task      | Doing    | false    |

      And "To Archive" button is visible for "Trashed Task"
      And "To Archive" button is hidden for "Doing Task"
      And "To Archive" button is hidden for "Archived Done"

  Rule: Workflow applies to both Tasks and Projects

    Scenario: Project follows same workflow as Task
      Given I have a Project "Website Redesign" with Draft status
      When I move it to Backlog
      And I start effort
      And I mark it as Done
      Then Project has same workflow transitions as Task
      And all timestamps are properly set

    Scenario: All buttons work for Projects
      Given I have a Project in each workflow state
      Then all workflow buttons appear correctly for Projects
      And all transitions work identically to Tasks

  Rule: Workflow state machine validation

    Scenario: Cannot skip workflow steps
      Given I have a Task with Draft status
      Then "Start Effort" button is not visible
      And "Done" button is not visible
      And only "To Backlog" and "Trash" buttons are visible

    Scenario: Forward-only progression (except Trash)
      Given I have a Task with Doing status
      Then I cannot move it back to Backlog
      And I cannot move it back to Draft
      And I can only move to Done or Trash

    Scenario: Terminal states are final
      Given I have a Task with Done status
      Then no workflow buttons are visible except "To Archive"
      And Task cannot transition to other workflow states

    Scenario: Command Palette reflects button availability
      Given I have a Task with Backlog status
      When I open Command Palette
      Then "Exocortex: Start Effort" command is available
      And "Exocortex: Move to Backlog" command is not available
      And "Exocortex: Mark as Done" command is not available
      And "Exocortex: Trash" command is available

  Rule: Timestamp preservation across transitions

    Scenario: Timestamps persist through workflow
      Given I have a Task with:
        | Property                      | Value                           |
        | ems__Effort_status            | [[ems__EffortStatusDraft]]      |
        | exo__Asset_createdAt          | 2025-10-15T09:00:00             |
      When I move to Backlog
      Then createdAt timestamp is preserved
      When I start effort
      Then createdAt timestamp is preserved
      And startTimestamp is added
      When I mark as Done
      Then createdAt timestamp is preserved
      And startTimestamp is preserved
      And endTimestamp is added
      And resolutionTimestamp is added

    Scenario: Trashing preserves existing timestamps but adds resolutionTimestamp
      Given I have a Doing Task with startTimestamp
      When I trash it
      Then startTimestamp is preserved
      And resolutionTimestamp is added
      And no endTimestamp is added

  Rule: Edge cases and error handling

    Scenario: Task without status shows Set Draft Status button
      Given I have a legacy Task without ems__Effort_status property
      Then "Set Draft Status" button is visible
      And no other workflow transition buttons are visible
      When I click "Set Draft Status" button
      Then Task property "ems__Effort_status" is set to "[[ems__EffortStatusDraft]]"
      And "Set Draft Status" button disappears
      And "Move to Backlog" button appears

    Scenario: Multiple status values handled correctly
      Given I have a Task with status array ["[[ems__EffortStatusBacklog]]", "[[CustomStatus]]"]
      Then workflow logic uses first status value
      And "Start Effort" button is visible

    Scenario: Status without wiki-link brackets
      Given I have a Task with:
        | Property            | Value                    |
        | ems__Effort_status  | ems__EffortStatusBacklog |
      Then workflow still recognizes the status
      And correct buttons are displayed
