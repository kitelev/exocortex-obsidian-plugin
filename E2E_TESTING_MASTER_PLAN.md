# üéØ E2E Testing Master Plan - Complete Mission

## Mission Statement
Create **100% real, honest E2E tests** that:
1. Test actual plugin functionality (not simulations)
2. Run in Docker (don't affect user's screen)
3. Pass in GitHub Actions
4. Cover all critical functionality
5. Provide genuine pass/fail results

## Current Reality Check
- ‚úÖ Unit tests work (`npm test`)
- ‚ùå Docker tests are fake (create HTML mockups)
- ‚ùå Playwright tests require desktop Obsidian (affects user screen)
- ‚ùå GitHub Actions can't run desktop Obsidian easily
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Web Obsidian doesn't support community plugins

## Task Decomposition

### Phase 1: Investigation & Analysis
- [ ] 1.1 Research Obsidian plugin testing approaches
- [ ] 1.2 Find how other successful plugins test
- [ ] 1.3 Investigate headless Obsidian possibilities
- [ ] 1.4 Research Electron testing in Docker
- [ ] 1.5 Analyze GitHub Actions capabilities

### Phase 2: Architecture Decision
- [ ] 2.1 Evaluate testing approaches:
  - Option A: Headless Electron with real Obsidian
  - Option B: Mock Obsidian API with real plugin code
  - Option C: Integration tests with stubbed Obsidian
  - Option D: Hybrid approach
- [ ] 2.2 Select best approach
- [ ] 2.3 Document architecture decision

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] 3.1 Set up Docker environment
- [ ] 3.2 Create test infrastructure
- [ ] 3.3 Write real tests for:
  - [ ] UniversalLayout
  - [ ] DynamicLayout
  - [ ] CreateAssetModal
  - [ ] Property rendering
  - [ ] Query execution
- [ ] 3.4 Capture real screenshots
- [ ] 3.5 Create test reports

### Phase 4: CI/CD Integration
- [ ] 4.1 Configure GitHub Actions
- [ ] 4.2 Set up Docker in CI
- [ ] 4.3 Run tests in CI
- [ ] 4.4 Fix any CI-specific issues
- [ ] 4.5 Add test badges to README

### Phase 5: Validation
- [ ] 5.1 Run all tests locally
- [ ] 5.2 Verify Docker isolation
- [ ] 5.3 Confirm GitHub Actions pass
- [ ] 5.4 Validate test coverage
- [ ] 5.5 Document everything

## Success Criteria
‚úÖ All tests run in Docker
‚úÖ No user screen interaction
‚úÖ GitHub Actions green
‚úÖ Real functionality tested
‚úÖ Honest pass/fail results
‚úÖ Screenshots show actual UI
‚úÖ 80%+ code coverage

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Obsidian needs GUI
**Solution**: Use Xvfb (virtual framebuffer) in Docker

### Challenge 2: Community plugins don't work in web
**Solution**: Use Electron in headless mode with Xvfb

### Challenge 3: Docker can't run Electron easily
**Solution**: Use specialized Electron Docker images

### Challenge 4: Plugin needs to be loaded
**Solution**: Create proper test vault structure

## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Research Phase
```bash
# Search for successful approaches
# Look at popular plugins: Dataview, Templater, etc.
# Check their testing strategies
```

### Step 2: Proof of Concept
```bash
# Create minimal Docker setup
# Test Electron + Xvfb
# Load Obsidian
# Load plugin
# Take screenshot
```

### Step 3: Full Implementation
```bash
# Build complete test suite
# Real tests for all components
# Automated reporting
```

## Progress Tracking

### Day 1 (Current)
- [x] Identified problem: Docker tests are fake
- [x] Created initial Playwright setup (desktop only)
- [ ] Starting comprehensive solution

### Next Steps
1. Research existing solutions
2. Create Docker + Electron POC
3. Implement real tests
4. Integrate with CI/CD

## Notes
- Must be 100% honest - no simulations
- User should never see test windows
- GitHub Actions must pass reliably
- Tests must catch real bugs
