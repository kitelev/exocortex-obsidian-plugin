Feature: Mobile Performance Optimization
  As a mobile user of the Exocortex plugin
  I want the plugin to perform efficiently on my mobile device
  So that I can have a smooth and responsive experience regardless of device limitations

  Background:
    Given the Exocortex plugin is installed and activated
    And I am using a mobile device with limited resources

  @performance @memory @optimization
  Scenario: Memory-Aware Performance Optimization
    Given I am using a mobile device with limited RAM (2GB or less)
    When the plugin loads and operates
    Then memory usage should be optimized for mobile constraints
    And batch sizes for operations should be reduced automatically
    And garbage collection should be triggered proactively
    When memory pressure is detected
    Then non-essential operations should be deferred
    And caching strategies should adapt to available memory
    And the plugin should not cause system-wide memory issues

  @performance @adaptive @device-detection
  Scenario: Adaptive Performance Based on Device Capabilities
    Given I am using devices with varying performance characteristics
    When the plugin detects device capabilities
    Then performance optimizations should be applied automatically
    And animation complexity should scale with device power
    And operation batch sizes should adjust to device capabilities
    When using older or slower devices
    Then more aggressive optimizations should be applied
    And optional visual effects should be reduced
    And processing should be distributed over time

  @performance @lazy-loading @resource-management
  Scenario: Lazy Loading and Resource Management
    Given I am viewing large knowledge graphs or datasets
    When content is loaded initially
    Then only visible or immediately needed content should load
    And content outside the viewport should load on demand
    And images and media should be loaded progressively
    When I scroll or navigate
    Then content should load smoothly without blocking
    And previously loaded content should be intelligently cached
    And unused resources should be cleaned up automatically

  @performance @indexing @search-optimization
  Scenario: Mobile-Optimized Indexing and Search
    Given I have large knowledge bases with thousands of items
    When search indexing occurs
    Then indexing should happen incrementally on mobile
    And background indexing should not block user interactions
    And index updates should be batched efficiently
    When I perform searches
    Then search should be responsive even on large datasets
    And search suggestions should appear quickly
    And search results should load progressively

  @performance @rendering @ui-optimization
  Scenario: UI Rendering Performance Optimization
    Given I am interacting with complex UI elements
    When UI components are rendered
    Then rendering should prioritize visible elements
    And smooth 60fps interactions should be maintained
    And layout calculations should be optimized for mobile
    When displaying large lists or tables
    Then virtual scrolling should be used for performance
    And only visible items should be rendered in DOM
    And scroll performance should remain smooth

  @performance @network @connectivity-aware
  Scenario: Network-Aware Performance Optimization
    Given I am using mobile internet with varying connectivity
    When the plugin needs to load external resources
    Then it should adapt to current connection speed
    And content should be compressed appropriately
    And caching should be optimized for mobile data usage
    When on slow connections (2G/3G)
    Then non-essential network requests should be deferred
    And critical content should be prioritized
    And offline capabilities should be maximized

  @performance @battery @power-optimization
  Scenario: Battery Life and Power Optimization
    Given I am concerned about battery life on my mobile device
    When the plugin runs continuously
    Then CPU usage should be minimized during idle periods
    And unnecessary background processing should be avoided
    And animations should be power-efficient
    When low battery is detected
    Then the plugin should enter power-saving mode
    And non-critical operations should be suspended
    And update frequencies should be reduced

  @performance @startup @loading-optimization
  Scenario: Startup and Loading Performance
    Given I am starting Obsidian with the plugin on mobile
    When the plugin initializes
    Then initialization should not significantly delay Obsidian startup
    And essential features should be available immediately
    And non-critical features can load progressively
    When loading large vaults
    Then loading should be prioritized by user needs
    And progress should be communicated clearly
    And the interface should remain responsive during loading

  @performance @interaction @responsiveness
  Scenario: Touch Interaction Responsiveness
    Given I am interacting with the plugin via touch
    When I tap, swipe, or gesture
    Then initial response should occur within 100ms
    And visual feedback should be immediate
    And complex operations should show progress immediately
    When performing rapid interactions
    Then the system should handle input queuing gracefully
    And no interactions should be lost or delayed
    And performance should not degrade with rapid use

  @performance @data-processing @efficient-operations
  Scenario: Efficient Data Processing Operations
    Given I am working with large datasets or complex operations
    When processing knowledge graphs or RDF data
    Then operations should be chunked for mobile processing
    And progress should be reported to prevent perceived freezing
    And users should be able to cancel long operations
    When performing bulk operations
    Then processing should use available mobile CPU efficiently
    And the UI should remain responsive during processing
    And background processing should yield to user interactions

  @performance @caching @intelligent-storage
  Scenario: Intelligent Caching and Storage Management
    Given I have limited storage space on my mobile device
    When the plugin caches data for performance
    Then cache size should be managed intelligently
    And least recently used data should be evicted appropriately
    And cache effectiveness should be monitored
    When storage space is low
    Then the plugin should reduce cache usage
    And users should be notified of storage constraints
    And essential data should be prioritized for retention

  @performance @concurrent @multi-tasking
  Scenario: Concurrent Operations and Multi-tasking Support
    Given I am running multiple operations simultaneously
    When the plugin handles concurrent requests
    Then operations should be prioritized by user importance
    And resource contention should be managed effectively
    And background tasks should not interfere with foreground
    When switching between apps on mobile
    Then the plugin should handle app backgrounding gracefully
    And resume efficiently when returning to foreground
    And state should be preserved appropriately

  @performance @monitoring @metrics-collection
  Scenario: Performance Monitoring and Metrics Collection
    Given I want to understand plugin performance on my device
    When the plugin operates over time
    Then key performance metrics should be tracked
    And performance issues should be detected automatically
    And users should receive feedback about performance problems
    When performance degrades
    Then the system should attempt automatic optimization
    And fallback strategies should be employed
    And users should be informed of performance adjustments

  @performance @graceful-degradation @fallback-strategies
  Scenario: Graceful Performance Degradation
    Given I am using an older or significantly constrained device
    When the plugin cannot maintain optimal performance
    Then it should gracefully reduce feature complexity
    And core functionality should remain available
    And users should be informed of performance limitations
    When specific features are too resource-intensive
    Then alternative implementations should be provided
    And users should be able to choose performance vs features
    And the system should remain stable and usable

  @performance @real-time @live-monitoring
  Scenario: Real-time Performance Monitoring and Adjustment
    Given the plugin is running on a mobile device with varying conditions
    When system resources change (memory pressure, battery level, etc.)
    Then the plugin should adjust its behavior in real-time
    And performance optimizations should be applied dynamically
    And users should see improved responsiveness from adjustments
    When optimal conditions return
    Then the plugin should gradually restore full functionality
    And the transition should be smooth and automatic
    And user experience should improve seamlessly
