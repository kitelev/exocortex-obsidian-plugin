Feature: Touch Gestures and Interactions
  As a mobile user
  I want to interact with the Exocortex plugin using natural touch gestures
  So that I can efficiently navigate and manipulate content on my mobile device

  Background:
    Given the Exocortex plugin is installed and activated
    And I am using a touch-enabled mobile device
    And the knowledge graph is displayed

  @touch @tap @happy-path
  Scenario: Basic Touch Tap Interactions
    Given I see interactive elements on the screen
    When I tap on a UI button
    Then it should provide immediate visual feedback
    And the tap should register within 100ms
    And the action should execute correctly
    When I tap on a node in the knowledge graph
    Then the node should be selected
    And related information should be displayed

  @touch @double-tap
  Scenario: Double Tap Gestures
    Given I am viewing the knowledge graph
    When I double-tap on a graph node
    Then the node should expand to show more details
    Or it should zoom into the node's neighborhood
    When I double-tap on empty space in the graph
    Then the graph should reset to default zoom level
    And the view should center appropriately

  @touch @long-press
  Scenario: Long Press Context Actions
    Given I am viewing content in the plugin
    When I long-press on a graph node for 600ms or more
    Then a context menu should appear
    And the menu should contain relevant actions
    And the menu should be positioned appropriately for the screen
    When I long-press on a property value
    Then an edit menu should appear
    And I should be able to copy, edit, or delete the value

  @touch @pan @graph-navigation
  Scenario: Pan Gestures for Graph Navigation
    Given the knowledge graph is displayed
    And the graph is larger than the viewport
    When I perform a pan gesture by dragging across the screen
    Then the graph should move smoothly in the direction of the pan
    And the movement should have appropriate momentum
    And boundaries should be respected to prevent over-panning
    When I release the pan gesture
    Then the graph should settle with smooth deceleration

  @touch @pinch @zoom
  Scenario: Pinch-to-Zoom for Graph Scaling
    Given the knowledge graph is displayed
    When I perform a pinch-out gesture with two fingers
    Then the graph should zoom in proportionally
    And the zoom should be centered on the pinch point
    And zoom limits should be respected (max zoom)
    When I perform a pinch-in gesture
    Then the graph should zoom out proportionally
    And minimum zoom limits should be respected
    And the entire graph should remain visible at minimum zoom

  @touch @swipe @navigation
  Scenario: Swipe Gestures for Navigation
    Given I am viewing a modal with multiple pages or tabs
    When I perform a horizontal swipe gesture
    Then the interface should navigate to the next/previous page
    And the transition should be smooth and animated
    When I perform a vertical swipe on a scrollable list
    Then the list should scroll in the appropriate direction
    And scroll momentum should feel natural

  @touch @multi-touch @advanced
  Scenario: Multi-Touch Interactions
    Given the knowledge graph supports multi-touch
    When I use two fingers to interact with different nodes simultaneously
    Then both interactions should be registered correctly
    And there should be no interference between touch points
    When I use three fingers to perform a gesture
    Then the gesture should be recognized appropriately
    Or it should gracefully ignore unsupported multi-touch actions

  @touch @haptic @feedback
  Scenario: Haptic Feedback on Touch Interactions
    Given my device supports haptic feedback
    And haptic feedback is enabled in settings
    When I tap on interactive elements
    Then I should receive appropriate haptic feedback
    When I perform successful actions (like saving)
    Then I should receive confirmation haptic feedback
    When I encounter errors or invalid actions
    Then I should receive warning haptic feedback
    When I reach boundaries (like max zoom)
    Then I should receive boundary haptic feedback

  @touch @edge-cases @accidental
  Scenario: Accidental Touch Prevention
    Given I am interacting with the interface
    When I accidentally brush the screen with my palm
    Then the touch should be ignored or filtered out
    When I rest my thumb on the screen while using my index finger
    Then only the intended touch should register
    When I perform unintentional gestures while holding the device
    Then the system should distinguish between intentional and accidental input

  @touch @precision @fine-control
  Scenario: Precision Touch for Detailed Work
    Given I need to interact with small interface elements
    When I tap on small buttons or links
    Then the touch target should be at least 44px for accessibility
    And the system should provide visual feedback for precise targeting
    When I need to make fine adjustments to graph positioning
    Then precision mode should be available for detailed control
    And I should be able to make small, controlled movements

  @touch @gesture-conflicts
  Scenario: System Gesture Conflict Resolution
    Given the device has system-level gestures (like back swipe)
    When I perform gestures within the plugin
    Then plugin gestures should not conflict with system gestures
    And the plugin should yield to system navigation when appropriate
    When system gestures are unavoidable
    Then the plugin should provide alternative interaction methods

  @touch @accessibility @assistive
  Scenario: Touch Accessibility for Assistive Technologies
    Given I am using assistive touch technologies
    When I interact with the plugin through assistive methods
    Then all functionality should remain accessible
    And touch accommodations should be supported
    And alternative input methods should work correctly
    When using switch control or similar technologies
    Then the interface should be fully navigable

  @touch @performance @responsiveness
  Scenario: Touch Performance and Responsiveness
    Given I am interacting with the plugin on a mobile device
    When I perform any touch gesture
    Then the initial response should occur within 16ms for 60fps
    And complex operations should show immediate feedback
    When multiple users perform gestures rapidly
    Then the system should handle input queuing gracefully
    And no gestures should be lost or delayed

  @touch @customization @preferences
  Scenario: Touch Gesture Customization
    Given I want to customize touch interactions
    When I access gesture settings
    Then I should be able to adjust gesture sensitivity
    And I should be able to enable/disable specific gestures
    And I should be able to customize gesture thresholds
    When I have motor accessibility needs
    Then gesture timing and pressure requirements should be adjustable

  @touch @error-recovery @gesture-mistakes
  Scenario: Gesture Error Recovery
    Given I make an incorrect gesture or touch
    When I realize the mistake immediately
    Then I should be able to cancel the gesture mid-execution
    And the system should return to the previous state
    When I perform an unrecognized gesture
    Then the system should ignore it gracefully
    And provide subtle feedback that the gesture was not recognized
