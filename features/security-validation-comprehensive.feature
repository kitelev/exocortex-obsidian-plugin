  @literal-validation @datatype-security @type-safety
  Scenario: Validate RDF literals against declared datatypes
    Given I am creating RDF triples with typed literals
    When I provide the following literal values:
      | literal_value    | declared_datatype                 | should_be_valid |

      | <script>        | http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string  | false    |
    Then literal validation should match expected results
    And type coercion should be applied where safe
    And dangerous content should be sanitized or rejected

  @query-injection @sparql-security @query-validation
  Scenario: Prevent SPARQL injection attacks
    Given I have a SPARQL query interface
    When I provide the following potentially malicious queries:
      | query_input                                      | threat_type        |
      | SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } ; DROP GRAPH <g>    | query_chaining     |

      | SELECT * WHERE { SERVICE <http://evil.com/> {}} | external_service   |
    Then all malicious queries should be rejected
    And the query parser should detect injection patterns
    And safe query execution should be maintained
    And detailed security logs should be created

  @file-access @path-validation @filesystem-security
  Scenario: Validate file paths and prevent unauthorized access
    Given I am importing or exporting data
    When I provide the following file paths:
      | file_path                           | should_be_allowed | reason                    |
      | ./data/export.ttl                  | true             | Relative path in safe dir |
      | /vault/notes/knowledge.rdf         | true             | Absolute path in vault    |
      | ../../../etc/passwd                | false            | Path traversal attempt    |

      | data/export.ttl; rm -rf /          | false            | Command injection         |
      | \\network-share\files\data.rdf     | false            | Network path not allowed  |
    Then path validation should match expected results
    And unauthorized paths should be blocked
    And safe paths should be canonicalized
    And all file access should be logged

  @data-size-limits @dos-prevention @resource-protection
  Scenario: Enforce data size and resource limits
    Given I am processing various types of data
    When I provide inputs with different sizes:
      | data_type       | size        | should_be_accepted | limit_type        |
      | rdf_graph       | 1MB         | true              | Normal processing |
      | rdf_graph       | 100MB       | false             | Memory limit      |
      | sparql_query    | 1KB         | true              | Normal query      |
      | sparql_query    | 1MB         | false             | Query complexity  |

      | property_count  | 100         | true              | Normal asset      |
      | property_count  | 10000       | false             | Property limit    |
    Then size limits should be enforced
    And resource exhaustion should be prevented
    And appropriate error messages should indicate limits
    And system stability should be maintained

      | ðŸŽ­emoji_content         | valid_emoji            | true             |
    Then character encoding should be handled safely
    And invalid sequences should be sanitized
    And bidirectional text attacks should be prevented
    And all text should be properly validated

  @permission-validation @access-control @authorization
  Scenario: Validate user permissions for operations
    Given I have different user permission levels
    When I attempt various operations:
      | operation          | permission_required | user_has_permission | should_succeed |

      | import_data        | import             | false               | false         |
      | modify_ontology    | admin              | true                | true          |
    Then operations should succeed only with proper permissions
    And unauthorized attempts should be logged
    And appropriate error messages should be returned
    And the system should fail securely

  @privacy-protection @data-anonymization @sensitive-data
  Scenario: Protect sensitive data and maintain privacy
    Given I have assets containing potentially sensitive information

      | encrypted_data     | Ensure proper encryption standards     |
      | random_tokens      | Validate entropy and uniqueness        |
    Then cryptographic validation should be performed
    And integrity checks should pass for valid data
    And tampered data should be detected and rejected
    And cryptographic errors should be handled securely

  @session-security @token-management @authentication
  Scenario: Manage session security and authentication tokens
    Given I have an active plugin session
    When I perform operations over time:
      | time_elapsed | operation_type    | expected_behavior              |
      | 5_minutes    | normal_operation  | Continue with valid session    |
      | 30_minutes   | sensitive_op      | Re-validate if configured      |
      | 4_hours      | any_operation     | Session should remain valid    |
      | 24_hours     | startup           | Check for session validity     |
    Then session management should be appropriate for a local plugin
    And any authentication tokens should be managed securely
    And sensitive operations should have additional validation
    And session data should be protected from tampering

    And log integrity should be maintained
    And sensitive data should not be logged in plain text

  @error-handling @security-failures @graceful-degradation
  Scenario: Handle security failures gracefully and securely
    Given the system encounters various security issues
    When security validation fails:
      | failure_type           | system_response                        |
      | input_validation_error | Reject input, log error, show safe msg|
      | permission_denied      | Return 403, log attempt, no details    |
      | resource_exhaustion    | Graceful degradation, rate limiting    |
      | crypto_validation_fail | Reject operation, secure cleanup       |
      | injection_attempt      | Block request, detailed logging        |
    Then the system should fail securely

    And appropriate error recovery should occur
    And the system should remain stable and functional

  @compliance @gdpr @data-protection
  Scenario: Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
    Given I am subject to data protection regulations
    When the system processes personal data:
      | compliance_requirement  | system_implementation              |

      | purpose_limitation      | Use data only for stated purpose   |
      | storage_limitation      | Implement data retention policies  |
      | accuracy_principle      | Provide data correction mechanisms |
      | security_safeguards     | Implement technical protections    |
      | user_rights            | Support access, deletion requests  |
    Then all compliance requirements should be met
    And user rights should be respected and supported
    And data processing should be lawful and transparent
    And appropriate documentation should be maintained

  @penetration-testing @security-assessment @vulnerability-scanning
  Scenario: Withstand common security attacks
    Given the system is under security assessment
    When common attack vectors are tested:

      | deserialization_attacks   | Malicious serialized objects         |
      | buffer_overflow           | Oversized inputs to cause overflow   |
    Then all attack vectors should be successfully defended
    And no unauthorized access should be possible
    And system stability should be maintained
    And security measures should log attack attempts

  @configuration-security @secure-defaults @hardening
  Scenario: Maintain secure configuration and defaults
    Given the plugin is being configured
    When security-related settings are evaluated:
      | setting_category        | secure_default           | rationale                    |
      | input_validation        | strict_mode_enabled       | Prevent malicious input      |
