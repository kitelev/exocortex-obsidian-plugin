  I want comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
  So that I can continue working effectively even when problems occur and my data remains safe

  Background:
    Given the Exocortex plugin is initialized
    And the error handling system is active
    And error logging is enabled
    And recovery mechanisms are available

  @error-classification @error-analysis @diagnostics

    And users should be informed of recovery progress for long operations

  @user-error-handling @input-validation @user-guidance
  Scenario: Handle user errors with helpful guidance
    Given a user provides invalid input or performs invalid actions
    When user errors occur:

    And backup data should be used when available
    And users should be warned about potential data loss

  @circuit-breaker @fault-tolerance @system-protection
  Scenario: Implement circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies
    Given the system uses external services or resources
    When external dependencies become unreliable:
      | dependency_type     | failure_threshold | circuit_behavior              |

      | large_query_engine | 3 timeouts        | Fallback to simple queries    |
      | export_service     | 50% failure rate  | Disable export, show message  |
    Then circuit breaker should open to prevent cascade failures
    And alternative functionality should be provided where possible
    And circuit should automatically attempt to close after cooldown
    And system health should be monitored and reported

  @error-reporting @diagnostics @support-information
  Scenario: Provide comprehensive error reporting for troubleshooting
    Given an error occurs that requires investigation
    When error reporting is generated

    And diagnostic data should help identify root causes

  @rollback-mechanisms @transaction-safety @data-consistency
  Scenario: Rollback changes when operations fail partway through
    Given complex operations that modify multiple data structures
    When an operation fails after partial completion:
      | operation_type       | partial_changes_made           | rollback_strategy          |
