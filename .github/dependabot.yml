    # Ignore all major version updates for stability and to avoid breaking changes.
    # Rationale: Major version updates often introduce breaking changes that can disrupt
    # the stability of our codebase or require significant refactoring. To minimize
    # the risk of unexpected failures and maintain a predictable update process,
    # we have chosen to ignore all major version updates by default. This policy ensures
    # that only minor and patch updates are applied automatically, and major updates
    # will be reviewed and tested manually before adoption.
