# GitHub Actions CI/CD Migration Notice

## ðŸš€ Migration to Optimized CI/CD Pipeline

We have migrated to a new optimized CI/CD pipeline that reduces execution time by 70-80% while maintaining comprehensive test coverage.

### New Workflow Structure

#### Active Workflows

1. **fast-feedback.yml** - Quick PR validation (2-3 minutes)
   - Runs on all PRs
   - Quick validation, parallel tests, UI smoke tests
2. **comprehensive-ci.yml** - Full test suite for main branch (4-5 minutes)
   - Runs on push to main
   - Full platform matrix, all test suites, performance checks

3. **auto-release.yml** - Automatic releases
   - Unchanged, runs on version bumps

4. **release.yml** - Tag-based releases
   - Unchanged, runs on tag pushes

### Temporarily Disabled Workflows

The following workflows have been disabled as their functionality is now covered by the new consolidated workflows:

- **all-tests.yml** â†’ Replaced by comprehensive-ci.yml
- **ci-optimized.yml** â†’ Replaced by fast-feedback.yml
- **ci.yml** â†’ Replaced by comprehensive-ci.yml
- **docker-ci-simple.yml** â†’ Functionality merged into comprehensive-ci.yml
- **plugin-validation.yml** â†’ Integrated into both new workflows
- **quality-gate.yml** â†’ Integrated into both new workflows
- **ui-tests.yml** â†’ Integrated into both new workflows

### Emergency Fallback

- **emergency-ci-stabilization.yml** - Kept as emergency fallback (not disabled)

### Benefits of Migration

- **70-80% faster CI execution**
- **Better resource utilization** through parallel execution
- **Shared caching** between jobs
- **Reduced complexity** from 14 to 4 active workflows
- **Stay within GitHub free tier** limits

### Rollback Instructions

If issues arise, workflows can be re-enabled by removing the `if: false` condition from the workflow files.

### Migration Timeline

- Phase 1: New workflows created and tested âœ…
- Phase 2: Concurrency groups added âœ…
- Phase 3: Old workflows disabled (current)
- Phase 4: After 2 weeks of stability, old workflows will be removed
