- **Sponsor**: Product Owner
- **Start Date**: 2025-01-22
- **Target Completion**: 2025-01-24 (3 days)
- **Project Classification**: Small Enhancement Project

### 2. Business Case
**Problem Statement**: Users currently cannot create child areas directly from parent ems__Area layouts, requiring manual navigation and setup, which reduces productivity and user experience.

**Solution**: Implement a "Create Child Zone" button that automatically pre-populates the CreateAssetModal with correct parent relationships and class assignments.

- Improved semantic graph integrity
- Enhanced user experience consistency

**Success Criteria**:
- Button renders correctly on ems__Area layouts
- Modal pre-populates with correct values
- All tests pass (>80% coverage)
- Zero critical defects in production

### 3. Project Scope
**In Scope**:
- Button rendering in ems__Area layouts
- Modal pre-population logic
- Integration with existing CreateChildAreaUseCase
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation updates

**Out of Scope**:
- UI/UX redesign of existing components
- Performance optimizations beyond standard practices
- New button types or commands
- Mobile-specific optimizations (covered by existing infrastructure)
