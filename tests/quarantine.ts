/**
 * Flaky Test Quarantine Configuration
 *
 * This file contains the list of known flaky tests that are temporarily
 * quarantined while being investigated or fixed.
 *
 * RULES FOR QUARANTINE:
 * 1. Every quarantined test MUST have an associated issue
 * 2. Quarantine should be temporary (max 30 days by default)
 * 3. Tests must be fixed or removed, not left in quarantine indefinitely
 * 4. Add clear reason explaining why the test is flaky
 *
 * @example
 * {
 *   file: 'packages/obsidian-plugin/tests/unit/services/MyService.test.ts',
 *   name: 'should handle async operation',
 *   issue: 'https://github.com/kitelev/exocortex-obsidian-plugin/issues/123',
 *   reason: 'Race condition when network is slow',
 *   quarantinedAt: '2025-01-15',
 *   owner: 'developer-name',
 * }
